It is thought to derive from a Ty3-gyspy LTR (long terminal repeat) retrotransposon and retains Gag and Pol-like domains. Here we show that the Gag domain of PEG10 can promote vesicle budding similar to the HIV p24 Gag protein. Expressed in a subset of mouse endocrine organs in addition to the placenta, PEG10 was identified as a substrate of the deubiquitinating enzyme USP9X. Consistent with PEG10 having a critical role in placental development, PEG10-deficient trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) exhibited impaired differentiation into placental lineages. PEG10 expressed in wild-type, differentiating TSCs was bound to many cellular RNAs including Hbegf (Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor), which is known to play an important role in placentation. Expression of Hbegf was reduced in PEG10-deficient TSCs suggesting that PEG10 might bind to and stabilize RNAs that are critical for normal placental development.},

  abstract = {Background: Air pollution exposure represents a major health threat to the developing foetus. DNA methylation is one of the most well-known molecular determinants of the epigenetic status of cells. Blood DNA methylation has been proven sensitive to air pollutants, but the molecular impact of air pollution on new-borns has so far received little attention. Objectives: We investigated whether nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM10), temperature and humidity during pregnancy are associated with differences in placental DNA methylation levels. Methods: Whole-genome DNA-methylation was measured using the Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip in the placenta of 668 newborns from the EDEN cohort. We designed an original strategy using a priori biological information to focus on candidate genes with a specific expression pattern in placenta (active or silent) combined with an agnostic epigenome-wide association study (EWAS). We used robust linear regression to identify CpGs and differentially methylated regions (DMR) associated with each exposure during short- and longterm time-windows. Results: The candidate genes approach identified nine CpGs mapping to 9 genes associated with prenatal NO2 and PM10 exposure [false discovery rate (FDR) p {$<$} 0.05]. Among these, the methylation level of 2 CpGs located in ADORA2B remained significantly associated with NO2 exposure during the 2nd trimester and whole pregnancy in the EWAS (FDR p {$<$} 0.05). EWAS further revealed associations between the environmental exposures under study and variations of DNA methylation of 4 other CpGs. We further identified 27 DMRs significantly (FDR p {$<$} 0.05) associated with air pollutants exposure and 13 DMRs with meteorological conditions. Conclusions: The methylation of ADORA2B, a gene whose expression was previously associated with hypoxia and pre-eclampsia, was consistently found here sensitive to atmospheric pollutants. In addition, air pollutants were associated to DMRs pointing towards genes previously implicated in preeclampsia, hypertensive and metabolic disorders. These findings demonstrate that air pollutants exposure at levels commonly experienced in the European population are associated with placental gene methylation and provide some mechanistic insight into some of the reported effects of air pollutants on preeclampsia.},

  abstract = {Acetaminophen is considered the safest antipyretic and analgesic medication for pregnant women. However, studies have reported that acetaminophen has endocrine disrupting properties and prenatal exposure has been associated with early life epigenetic changes and later life health outcomes. As the placenta is the central mediator of maternal and fetal interactions, exposure to acetaminophen during pregnancy could manifest as perturbations in the placenta epigenome. Here, we evaluated epigenome-wide cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) methylation in placental tissue in relation to maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy in a cohort of 286 newborns born prior to 28 weeks gestation. According to maternal self-report, more than half (166 of 286) of the newborns were exposed to acetaminophen in utero. After adjustment for potential confounders, a total of 42 CpGs were identified to be differentially methylated at a false discovery rate {$<$} 0.05, with most displaying increased methylation as it relates to acetaminophen exposure. A notable gene that was significantly associated with acetaminophen is the prostaglandin receptor (PTGDR) which plays an essential role in mediating placental blood flow and fetal growth. Moreover, for 6 of the 42 CpGs, associations of acetaminophen use with methylation were significantly different between male and female placentas; 3 CpG sites were associated with acetaminophen use in the male placenta and 3 different sites were associated with acetaminophen use in the female placenta (Pinteraction {$<$} 0.2). These findings highlight a relationship between maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the placental epigenome and suggest that the responses for some CpG sites are sex dependent.},

  abstract = {Background: The gut microbiome plays an important role in the development of disease. The composition of the microbiome is influenced by factors such as mode of delivery at birth, diet and antibiotic use, yet the influence of environmental chemical exposures is largely unknown. The antimicrobial compound triclosan, found in many personal care products and widely detected in human urine, is an environmental exposure for which systemic microbiotic effects may be of particular interest. To investigate the relationship between triclosan and gut microflora, we assessed the association between triclosan and enterolactone, an intestinal metabolite that is produced via bacterial transformation of dietary lignans (seeds, nuts) and has known susceptibility to oral antibiotics. Methods: We examined urinary triclosan and enterolactone for 2005-2008 U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey subjects, aged Z20 years (n {$\frac{1}{4}$}3041). We also examined the association between prescription antibiotic use and enterolactone to confirm its susceptibility to changes in bacterial composition of the body. Associations between natural log-transformed enterolactone and (1) detected vs. not detected ( o2.3 ng/mL) triclosan, (2) triclosan quintiles (Q1\textendash Q5), and (3) any vs. no antibiotics were estimated with multiple linear regression, adjusting for sex, age, race, body mass index, poverty income ratio, education, fiber intake, bowel movement frequency, cotinine and creatinine (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 2441). Results: Triclosan was detected in 80\% of subjects (range: o 2.3\textendash 3620 ng/mL), while enterolactone was detected in 4 99\% of subjects (range: o0.1\textendash 122,000 ng/mL). After adjustment, enterolactone was not associated with triclosan (detect vs. non-detect: {$\beta\frac{1}{4}$} 0.07 (95\% CI: \`A 0.15, 0.30); Q5 (Z 104.5 ng/mL) vs. Q1 (none): {$\beta$} {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.06 (95\% CI: \`A 0.21, 0.34)). In sex-stratified analyses, triclosan was associated with higher enterolactone in women (detect vs. non-detect: {$\beta$} {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.31 (95\% CI: \`A 0.07, 0.70), but not men {$\beta$} {$\frac{1}{4}$} \`A 0.18 (95\% CI: \`A 0.47, 0.11). However, any antibiotic use (n {$\frac{1}{4}$}112), as compared to no antibiotic use, was associated with significantly lower enterolactone ({$\beta$} {$\frac{1}{4}$} \`A 0.78 (95\%CI: \`A 1.22, \`A0.36)), with no sex-specific effects. This association was driven by inverse associations with the following antibiotic classes: macrolide derivatives, quinolones, sulfonamides, and lincomycin derivatives. Conclusions: Antibiotics, but not triclosan, are negatively associated with urinary enterolactone. Antibiotics may reduce enterolactone by killing certain gut bacteria. At levels detected in the U.S., triclosan does not appear to be acting similarly, despite broad antimicrobial properties. Additional study of determinants of triclosan exposure and enterolactone production may be needed to better understand positive associations among women.},

  abstract = {Background Although urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites are frequently used as biomarkers in epidemiologic studies, variability during pregnancy has not been characterized. Methods We measured phthalate metabolite concentrations in spot urine samples collected from 246 pregnant Dominican and African-American women. Twenty-eight women had repeat urine samples collected over a 6-week period. We also analyzed 48-hr personal air samples (n = 96 women) and repeated indoor air samples (n = 32 homes) for five phthalate diesters. Mixed-effects models were fit to evaluate reproducibility via intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of using a single specimen versus repeat samples to classify a woman's exposure in the low or high category. Results Phthalates were detected in 85\textendash 100\% of air and urine samples. ICCs for the unadjusted urinary metabolite concentrations ranged from 0.30 for mono-ethyl phthalate to 0.66 for monobenzyl phthalate. For indoor air, ICCs ranged from 0.48 [di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP)] to 0.83 [butylbenzyl phthalate (BBzP)]. Air levels of phthalate diesters correlated with their respective urinary metabolite concentrations for BBzP (r = 0.71), di-isobutyl phthalate (r = 0.44), and diethyl phthalate (DEP; r = 0.39). In women sampled late in pregnancy, specific gravity appeared to be more effective than creatinine in adjusting for urine dilution. Conclusions Urinary concentrations of DEP and DEHP metabolites in pregnant women showed lower reproducibility than metabolites for di-n-butyl phthalate and BBzP. A single indoor air sample may be sufficient to characterize phthalate exposure in the home, whereas urinary phthalate biomarkers should be sampled longitudinally during pregnancy to minimize exposure misclassification.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prenatal urinary concentrations of phthalates in women participants in an urban birth cohort were associated with outcomes in their children related to neurodevelopment, autoimmune disease risk, and fat mass at 3,5,7, and 8~years of life. Placental biomarkers and outcomes at birth may offer biologic insight into these associations. This is the first study to address these associations with candidate genes from the phthalate and placenta literature, accounting for sex differences, and using absolute quantitation methods for mRNA levels. METHODS: We measured candidate mRNAs in 180 placentas sampled at birth (HSD17B1, AHR, CGA, CYP19A1, SLC27A4, PTGS2, PPARG, CYP11A1) by quantitative PCR and an absolute standard curve. We estimated associations of loge mRNA with quartiles of urinary phthalate monoesters using linear mixed models. Phthalate metabolites (N\,=\,358) and mRNAs (N\,=\,180) were transformed to a z-score and modeled as independent, correlated vectors in relation to large for gestational age (LGA) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). RESULTS: CGA was associated with 4 out of 6 urinary phthalates. CGA was 2.0 loge units lower at the 3rd vs. 1st quartile of mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) (95\% confidence interval (CI): -3.5, -0.5) in male placentas, but 0.6 loge units higher (95\% CI: -0.8, 1.9) in female placentas (sex interaction p\,=\,0.01). There was an inverse association of MnBP with PPARG in male placentas (-1.1 loge units at highest vs. lowest quartile, 95\% CI: -2.0, -0.1). CY19A1, CYP11A1, CGA were associated with one or more of the following in a sex-specific manner: monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), MnBP, mono-iso-butyl phthalate (MiBP). These 3 mRNAs were lower by 1.4-fold (95\% CI: -2.4, -1.0) in male GDM placentas vs. female and non-GDM placentas (p-value for interaction\,=\,0.04). The metabolites MnBP/MiBP were 16\% higher (95\% CI: 0, 22) in GDM pregnancies. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal concentrations of certain phthalates and outcomes at birth were modestly associated with molecular changes in fetal placental tissue during pregnancy. Associations were stronger in male vs. female placentas, and associations with MnBP and MiBP were stronger than other metabolites. Placental mRNAs are being pursued further as potential mediators of exposure-induced risks to the health of the child.},

The authors estimated associations between concentrations of DEHP metabolites and gestational age at delivery using linear regression models and associations between DEHP metabolites and clinical outcomes using logistic regression models. After covariate adjustment, women at the 75th percentile of DEHP metabolite concentrations had a 2-day-longer mean length of gestation than women at the 25th percentile (95\% confidence interval: 1.4, 3.3). Log-unit increases in mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate and mono-2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl phthalate concentrations were associated with increased odds of cesarean section delivery (30\% and 50\% increased odds, respectively), increased odds of delivering at 41 weeks or later (100\% and 120\% increased odds), and reduced odds of preterm delivery (50\% and 60\% decreased odds).

Methods: We measured seven target genes in placentas collected from 54 Dominican and AfricanAmerican women at delivery in New York City using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), normalized to 18S rRNA. qPCR results for the target genes were log-transformed, converted to Z-scores, and grouped into two functional pathways: steroidogenesis (aromatase, cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme, 17{$\beta$}-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, and cytochrome P450 1B1) and trophoblast differentiation (PPAR{$\gamma$}, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, and human chorionic gonadotropin). Repeated measures models were used to evaluate the association of phthalate metabolites measured in third-trimester urine samples with each group of target genes, accounting for correlation among the genes within a pathway. Results: Higher urinary concentrations of five phthalate metabolites were associated with lower expression of the target genes reflecting trophoblast differentiation. Results were less consistent for genes in the steroidogenesis pathway and suggested a nonlinear dose\textendash response pattern for some phthalate metabolites. Conclusions: We observed a significant association between prenatal exposure to phthalates and placental gene expression within two pathways. Further studies are warranted to understand the significance of this association with respect to fetal development and placental function.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Prenatal exposure to phthalates disrupts male sex development in rodents. In humans, the placental glycoprotein hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is required for male development, and may be a target of phthalate exposure. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to test the hypothesis that phthalates disrupt placental hCG differentially in males and females with consequences for sexually dimorphic genital development. DESIGN: The Infant Development and Environment Study (TIDES) is a prospective birth cohort. Pregnant women were enrolled from 2010-2012 at four university hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were TIDES subjects (n = 541) for whom genital and phthalate measurements were available and who underwent prenatal serum screening in the first or second trimester. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes included hCG levels in maternal serum in the first and second trimesters and anogenital distance (AGD), which is the distance from the anus to the genitals in male and female neonates. RESULTS: Higher first-trimester urinary mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP; P = .01), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP; P = .03), and mono-carboxy-isooctyl phthalate (P {$<$} .01) were associated with higher first-trimester hCG in women carrying female fetuses, and lower hCG in women carrying males. First-trimester hCG was positively correlated with the AGD z score in female neonates, and inversely correlated in males (P = 0.01). We measured significant associations of MnBP (P {$<$} .01), MBzP (P = .02), and mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP; P {$<$} .01) with AGD, after adjusting for sex differences. Approximately 52\% (MnBP) and 25\% (MEHP) of this association in males, and 78\% in females (MBzP), could be attributed to the phthalate association with hCG. CONCLUSIONS: First-trimester hCG levels, normalized by fetal sex, may reflect sexually dimorphic action of phthalates on placental function and on genital development.},

  abstract = {Background: Observational studies have reported associations between maternal phthalate levels and adverse outcomes at birth and in the health of the child. Effects on placental function have been suggested as a biologic basis for these findings. Objective: We evaluated the effects of phthalates on placental function in vitro by measuring relevant candidate genes and proteins. Materials and Methods: Human trophoblast progenitor cells were isolated at 7\textendash 14 wk of pregnancy (two female and three male concepti), and villous cytotrophoblast cells (vCTBs) were isolated at 15\textendash 20 wk (three female and four male concepti). Cells were cultured in vitro with four phthalate metabolites and their combination at concentrations based on levels found previously in the urine of pregnant women: mono-n-butyl (MnBP, 200\,nM), monobenzyl (MBzP, 3{$\mu$}M), mono-2-ethylhexyl (MEHP, 700\,nM), and monoethyl (MEP, 1.5{$\mu$}M) phthalates. mRNA levels of CGA, CGB, PPARG, CYP19A1, CYP11A1, PTGS2, EREG, and the intracellular {$\beta$} subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG{$\beta$}) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor {$\gamma$} (PPAR{$\gamma$}) were measured in the cellular extracts, and protein levels for four forms of secreted hCG were measured in the conditioned media. Results: Previously reported associations between maternal phthalates and placental gene expression were reproduced experimentally: MnBP with CGA, MBzP with CYP11A1, and MEHP with PTGS2. CGB and hCG{$\beta$} were up-regulated by MBzP. In some cases, there were marked, even opposite, differences in response by sex of the cells. There was evidence of agonism in female cells and antagonism in male cells of PPAR{$\gamma$} by simultaneous exposure to multiple phthalates. Conclusions: Concentrations of MnBP, MBzP and MEHP similar to those found in the urine of pregnant women consistently altered hCG and PPAR{$\gamma$} expression in primary placental cells. These findings provide evidence for the molecular basis by which phthalates may alter placental function, and they provide a preliminary mechanistic hypothesis for opposite responses by sex. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1539},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The exposome constitutes a promising framework to improve understanding of the effects of environmental exposures on health by explicitly considering multiple testing and avoiding selective reporting. However, exposome studies are challenged by the simultaneous consideration of many correlated exposures. OBJECTIVES: We compared the performances of linear regression-based statistical methods in assessing exposome-health associations. METHODS: In a simulation study, we generated 237 exposure covariates with a realistic correlation structure and with a health outcome linearly related to 0 to 25 of these covariates. Statistical methods were compared primarily in terms of false discovery proportion (FDP) and sensitivity. RESULTS: On average over all simulation settings, the elastic net and sparse partial least-squares regression showed a sensitivity of 76\% and an FDP of 44\%; Graphical Unit Evolutionary Stochastic Search (GUESS) and the deletion/substitution/addition (DSA) algorithm revealed a sensitivity of 81\% and an FDP of 34\%. The environment-wide association study (EWAS) underperformed these methods in terms of FDP (average FDP, 86\%) despite a higher sensitivity. Performances decreased considerably when assuming an exposome exposure matrix with high levels of correlation between covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Correlation between exposures is a challenge for exposome research, and the statistical methods investigated in this study were limited in their ability to efficiently differentiate true predictors from correlated covariates in a realistic exposome context. Although GUESS and DSA provided a marginally better balance between sensitivity and FDP, they did not outperform the other multivariate methods across all scenarios and properties examined, and computational complexity and flexibility should also be considered when choosing between these methods.

  abstract = {The exposome calls for assessing numerous exposures, typically using biomarkers with varying amounts of measurement error, which can be assumed to be of classical type. We evaluated the impact of classical-type measurement error on the performance of exposome-health studies, and the efficiency of two measurement error correction methods relying on the collection of repeated biospecimens: within-subject biospecimens pooling and regression calibration. In a simulation study, we generated 237 exposures from a realistic correlation matrix, with various amounts of classical-type measurement error, and a continuous health outcome linearly influenced by exposures. Measurement error decreased the sensitivity to identify exposures influencing health from a value of 75\% down to 46\%, increased false discovery proportion from 26\% to 49\% and increased attenuation bias in the slope of true predictors from 45\% to 66\%. Assuming that repeated biospecimens were available, withinsubject pooling and regression calibration improved sensitivity (which increased to 63\%), false discovery proportion (down to 37\%) and bias (down to 49\%) compared to an error-prone study with a single biospecimen per subject. Performances were poorer for the exposures with the largest amount of measurement error, and increased with the number of available biospecimens. Relying on repeated biospecimens only for the exposures with the largest amount of measurement error provided similar performance improvement. Exposome studies relying on spot exposure biospecimens suffer from decreased performances if some biomarkers suffer from measurement error due to their temporal variability; performances can be improved by collecting repeated biospecimens per subject, in particular for non persistent chemicals.},

  abstract = {Introduction Phenols and parabens are ubiquitous environmental contaminants. Evidence from animal studies and limited human data suggest they may be endocrine disruptors. In the current study, we examined associations of phenols and parabens with reproductive and thyroid hormones in 106 pregnant women recruited for the prospective cohort, ``Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT)''. Methods Urinary exposure biomarkers (bisphenol A, triclosan, benzophenone-3, 2,4-dichlorophenol, 2,5-dichlorophenol, butyl, methyl and propyl paraben) and serum hormone levels (estradiol, progesterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4) and thyroid stimulating hormone) were measured at up to two time points during pregnancy (16\textendash 20 weeks and 24\textendash 28 weeks). We used linear mixed models to assess relationships between exposure biomarkers and hormone levels across pregnancy, controlling for urinary specific gravity, maternal age, BMI and education. In sensitivity analyses, we evaluated cross-sectional relationships between exposure and hormone levels stratified by study visit using linear regression. Results An IQR increase in methyl paraben was associated with a 7.70\% increase (95\% CI 1.50, 13.90) in SHBG. Furthermore, an IQR increase in butyl paraben as associated with an 8.46\% decrease (95\% CI 16.92, 0.00) in estradiol, as well as a 9.34\% decrease (95\% CI -18.31,-0.38) in estradiol/progesterone. Conversely, an IQR increase in butyl paraben was associated with a 5.64\% increase (95\% CI 1.26, 10.02) in FT4. Progesterone was consistently negatively associated with phenols, but none reached statistical significance. After stratification, methyl and propyl paraben were suggestively negatively associated with estradiol at the first time point (16\textendash 20 weeks), and suggestively positively associated with estradiol at the second time point (24\textendash 28 weeks). Conclusions Within this ongoing birth cohort, certain phenols and parabens were associated with altered reproductive and thyroid hormone levels during pregnancy. These changes may contribute to adverse health effects in mothers or their offspring, but additional research is required.},

  abstract = {Background: A number of phenols and parabens are added to consumer products for a variety of functions, and have been found at detectable levels in the majority of the U.S. population. Among other functions, thyroid hormones are essential in fetal neurodevelopment, and could be impacted by the endocrine disrupting effects of phenols and parabens. The present study investigated the association between ten maternal urinary phenol and paraben biomarkers (bisphenol S, triclosan, triclocarban, benzophenone-3, 2,4-dichlorophenol, 2,5-dichlorophenol, and ethyl, butyl, methyl and propyl paraben) and four plasma thyroid hormones in 439 pregnant women in a case\textendash control sample nested within a cohort study based in Boston, MA. Methods: Urine and blood samples were collected from up to four visits during pregnancy (median weeks of gestation at each visit: Visit 1: 9.64, Visit 2: 17.9, Visit 3: 26.0, Visit 4: 35.1). Linear mixed models were constructed to take into account the repeated measures jointly, followed by multivariate linear regression models stratified by gestational age to explore potential windows of susceptibility. Results: We observed decreased total triiodothyronine (T3) in relation to an IQR increase in benzophenone-3 (percent change [\%{$\Delta$}] = -2.07; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = -4.16, 0.01), butyl paraben (\%{$\Delta$} = -2.76; 95\% CI = -5.25, -0.26) and triclosan (\%{$\Delta$} = -2.53; 95\% CI = -4.75, -0.30), and triclocarban at levels above the LOD (\%{$\Delta$} = -5.71; 95\% CI = -10.45, -0.97). A 2.41\% increase in T3 was associated with an IQR increase in methyl paraben (95\% CI = 0.58, 4.24). We also detected a negative association between free thyroxine (FT4) and propyl paraben (\%{$\Delta$} = -3.14; 95\% CI = -6.12, -0.06), and a suggestive positive association between total thyroxine (T4) and methyl paraben (\%{$\Delta$} = 1.19; 95\% CI = -0.10, 2.47). Gestational age-specific multivariate regression analyses showed that the magnitude and direction of some of the observed associations were dependent on the timing of exposure. Conclusion: Certain phenols and parabens were associated with altered thyroid hormone levels during pregnancy, and the timing of exposure influenced the association between phenol and paraben, and hormone concentrations. These changes may contribute to downstream maternal and fetal health outcomes. Additional research is required to replicate the associations, and determine the potential biological mechanisms underlying the observed associations.},

High doses of BPA have been shown to change expression and regulation of one such gene, Grin2b, in mice. Yet, if such changes occur at relevant doses in animals and humans has not been addressed. We investigated if low-dose developmental BPA exposure affects DNA methylation and expression of Grin2b in brains of adult rats. Furthermore, we assessed associations between prenatal BPA exposure and Grin2b methylation in 7-year old children. We found that Grin2b mRNA expression was increased and DNA methylation decreased in female, but not in male rats. In humans, prenatal BPA exposure was associated with increased methylation levels in girls. Additionally, low APGAR scores, a predictor for increased risk for neurodevelopmental diseases, were associated with higher Grin2b methylation levels in girls. Thus, we could link developmental BPA exposure and low APGAR scores to changes in the epigenetic regulation of Grin2b, a gene important for neuronal function, in a sexual dimorphic fashion. Discrepancies in exact locations and directions of the DNA methylation change might reflect differences between species, analysed tissues, exposure level and/or timing.},

Extracellular activation of the latent TGF-{$\beta$} complex is a crucial step in the regulation of TGF-{$\beta$} function for tissue homeostasis. We show that the fibrinogen-like (FBG) domain of the matrix glycoprotein tenascin-X (TNX) interacts physically with the small latent TGF-{$\beta$} complex in vitro and in vivo, thus regulating the bioavailability of mature TGF-{$\beta$} to cells by activating the latent cytokine into an active molecule. Activation by the FBG domain most likely occurs through a conformational change in the latent complex and involves a novel cell adhesion\textendash dependent mechanism. We identify {$\alpha$}11{$\beta$}1 integrin as a cell surface receptor for TNX and show that this integrin is crucial to elicit FBG-mediated activation of latent TGF-{$\beta$} and subsequent epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in mammary epithelial cells.},

There are many approaches to answering this question, but they generally fall into two categories: measures of predictive power (like R-square) and goodness of fit tests (like the Pearson chi-square). This presentation looks first at R-square measures, arguing that the optional R-squares reported by PROC LOGISTIC might not be optimal. Measures proposed by McFadden and Tjur appear to be more attractive. As for goodness of fit, the popular Hosmer and Lemeshow test is shown to have some serious problems.

In this study, plasma and milk were sampled from 36 mothers and analyzed for triclosan. Scrutinization of the women's personal care products revealed that nine of the mothers used toothpaste, deodorant or soap containing triclosan. Triclosan and/or its metabolites were omnipresent in the analyzed plasma and milk. The concentrations were higher in both plasma and milk from the mothers who used personal care products containing triclosan than in the mothers who did not. This demonstrated that personal care products containing triclosan were the dominant, but not the only, source of systemic exposure to triclosan. The concentrations were significantly higher in plasma than in milk, indicating that infant exposure to triclosan via breast milk is much less than the dose in the mother.},

Several studies have reported on the transfer of this compound to food. Regarding human exposure to BPA, food intake can be considered the most serious among all the routes, not only because it potentially reaches more people in different age groups (including infants, an especially vulnerable group), but also because it inadvertently occurs over long time periods. BPA is considered an endocrine disruptor and several studies have proposed a relationship between exposure to BPA and the appearance of adverse health effects, such as cancer, infertility, diabetes, and obesity, among others. In 2015 however, the European Food Safety Authority concluded in its last scientific opinion that this compound does not pose any risk to the exposed population's health. Therefore, the EU regards BPA as an authorized product to be used as food contact material. Although BPA intake through food is apparently below the set limits, research into BPA and its potential negative effects is still ongoing. This review contains the most recent in vitro and in vivo studies on BPA toxicity and its harmful effects on health, and it intends to address human exposure to BPA, namely through dietary exposure and its impact on human health.},

However, large genetic association studies can only explain a fraction of the observed variability and striking secular trends suggest that lifestyle and/or environmental factors are important. Using liquid-chromatography tandem-mass-spectrometry, we measured endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs; triclosan, bisphenol A, benzophenone-3, 2,4-dichlorophenol, 11 metabolites from 5 phthalates) in longitudinal urine samples obtained biannually from peri-pubertal children included in the COPENHAGEN puberty cohort. EDC levels were associated with blood DNA methylation profiles from 31 boys and 20 girls measured both pre- and post-pubertally. We found little evidence of single methylation sites that on their own showed association with urinary excretion levels of EDCs obtained either the same-day or measured as the yearly mean of dichotomized EDC levels. In contrast, methylation of several promoter regions was found to be associated with two or more EDCs, overlap with known gene-chemical interactions, and form a core network with genes known to be important for puberty. Furthermore, children with the highest yearly mean of dichotomized urinary phthalate metabolite levels were associated with higher promoter methylation of the thyroid hormone receptor interactor 6 gene (TRIP6), which again was mirrored by lower circulating TRIP6 protein levels. In general, the mean TRIP6 promoter methylation was mirrored by circulating TRIP6 protein levels. Our results provide a potential molecular mode of action of how exposure to environmental chemicals may modify pubertal development.},

Our aim was to analyze whether BPA or BP3 direct exposure affects the functional differentiation of the mammary gland using an in vitro model. Mammary organoids were obtained and isolated from 8 week-old virgin female C57BL/6 mice and were differentiated on Matrigel with medium containing lactogenic hormones and exposed to: a) vehicle (0.01\% ethanol); b) 1~\texttimes ~10-9~M or 1~\texttimes ~10-6~M BPA; or c) 1~\texttimes ~10-12~M, 1~\texttimes ~10-9~M or 1~\texttimes ~10-6~M BP3 for 72~h. The mRNA and protein expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) and progesterone receptor (PR) were assessed. In addition, mRNA levels of PR-B isoform, glucocorticoid receptor (GR), prolactin receptor (PRLR) and Stat5a, and protein expression of pStat5a/b were evaluated at 72~h. The mRNA and protein expression of milk proteins and their DNA methylation status were also analyzed. Although mRNA level of PRLR and GR was similar between treatments, mRNA expression of ESR1, total PR, PR-B and Stat5a was increased in organoids exposed to 1~\texttimes ~10-9~M BPA and 1~\texttimes ~10-12~M BP3. Total PR expression was also increased with 1~\texttimes ~10-6~M BPA. Nuclear ESR1 and PR expression was observed in all treated organoids; whereas nuclear pStat5a/b alveolar cells was observed only in organoids exposed to 1~\texttimes ~10-9~M BPA and 1~\texttimes ~10-12~M BP3. The beta-casein mRNA level was increased in both BPA concentrations and 1~\texttimes ~10-12~M BP3, which was associated with hypomethylation of its promoter. The beta-casein protein expression was only increased with 1~\texttimes ~10-9~M BPA or 1~\texttimes ~10-12~M BP3. In contrast, BPA exposure decreased alpha-lactalbumin mRNA expression and increased DNA methylation level in different methylation-sensitive sites of the gene. Also, 1~\texttimes ~10-9~M BPA decreased alpha-lactalbumin protein expression. Our results demonstrate that BPA or BP3 exposure alters milk protein synthesis and its transcriptional regulation during mammary gland differentiation in vitro.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Children are susceptible to environmental contaminants and are at risk of developing diseases, more so if the exposure begins at an early age. Epidemiological studies have postulated the hypothesis of the fetal origin of disease, which is mediated by epigenetic changes. Epigenetic marks are inheritable; they modulate the gene expression and can affect human health due to the presence of environmental factors. OBJECTIVE: This review focuses on DNA-methylation and its association with environmental-related diseases in children. METHODS: A search for studies related to DNA-methylation in children by pre- or post-natal environmental exposures was conducted, and those studies with appropriate designs and statistical analyses and evaluations of the exposure were selected. FINDINGS: Prenatal and early life environmental factors, from diet to exposure to pollutants, have been associated with epigenetic changes, specifically DNA-methylation. Thus, maternal nutrition and smoking and exposure to air particulate matter, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, arsenic, heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants, and some endocrine disrupters during pregnancy have been associated with genomic and gene-specific newborns' DNA-methylation changes that have shown in some cases sex-specific patterns. In addition, these maternal factors may deregulate the placental DNA-methylation balance and could induce a fetal reprogramming and later-in-life diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to environmental pollutants during prenatal and early life can trigger epigenetic imbalances and eventually the development of diseases in children. The integration of epigenetic data should be considered in future risk assessments.},

However, the molecular mechanisms that control activation of their neurogenic program remain poorly understood. Here, we report a novel function for the pluripotency factor sex-determining region Y (SRY)-related HMG box 2 (SOX2) in regulating the epigenetic landscape of poised genes activated at the onset of neuronal differentiation. We found that SOX2 binds to bivalently marked promoters of poised proneural genes [neurogenin 2 (Ngn2) and neurogenic differentiation 1 (NeuroD1)] and a subset of neurogenic genes [e.g., SRY-box 21 (Sox21), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf), and growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible, beta (Gadd45b)] where it functions to maintain the bivalent chromatin state by preventing excessive polycomb repressive complex 2 activity. Conditional ablation of SOX2 in adult hippocampal NPCs impaired the activation of proneural and neurogenic genes, resulting in increased neuroblast death and functionally aberrant newborn neurons. We propose that SOX2 sets a permissive epigenetic state in NPCs, thus enabling proper activation of the neuronal differentiation program under neurogenic cue.},

  abstract = {Bisphenol A (BPA) is one of the organic compounds that might interfere with estrogenic receptors, which would make difficulties in pregnancy hormones and fetal growth. Human chorionic gonadotropin ({$\beta$}-hCG) is one of the important pregnancy hormones that might be affected by environmental pollutants. The aim of this study is to investigate the probable impacts of maternal exposure to BPA on anthropometric measures of newborns. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2019-2020 in Isfahan, Iran. During the first trimester of pregnancy, we measured the urinary BPA concentration and serum {$\beta$}-hCG level of 120 pregnant women, who were randomly selected from participants of a birth cohort. BPA concentration was measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Serum blood sample was derived and used for {$\beta$}-hCG analysis. Anthropometric measurement of neonates was conducted at the time of birth. BPA and {$\beta$}-hCG level were grouped by quartiles, and their associations with birth weight, height, and head circumference were tested using multiple linear regression model. The adjustment was done for urine creatinine, gender, and gestational age, as well as maternal age, body mass index, and education level. Data of 119 pairs of mothers and infants were available for the present study. The mean (SD) age of mothers was 29.19 (5.75) years; 56.3\% of newborns were boys. Geometric mean of urinary BPA and {$\beta$}-hCG concentrations were 0.36 ng/g crea. (creatinine) and 17736 mIU/ml, respectively. Across the BPA tertiles, the differences in mean values were not significant for none of the anthropometric measurements and gestational age (GA). Furthermore, no significant association existed between unadjusted and adjusted tertiles of BPA and {$\beta$}-hCG with abovementioned birth outcomes. It seems that the non-significant association found in this study is because of low levels of urinary BPA levels than in other studies; the adverse effects on infants might be related to high concentration of BPA passed from placenta. Future longitudinal studies with large sample size are necessary to document the adverse health effects of maternal exposure to endocrine disruptor chemicals including BPA.},

  abstract = {Paracetamol has a central analgesic effect that is mediated through activation of descending serotonergic pathways. Debate exists about its primary site of action, which may be inhibition of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis or through an active metabolite influencing cannabinoid receptors. Prostaglandin H2 synthetase (PGHS) is the enzyme responsible for metabolism of arachidonic acid to the unstable PGH2. The two major forms of this enzyme are the constitutive PGHS-1 and the inducible PGHS-2. PGHS comprises of two sites: a cyclooxygenase (COX) site and a peroxidase (POX) site. The conversion of arachidonic acid to PGG2 is dependent on a tyrosine-385 radical at the COX site. Formation of a ferryl protoporphyrin IX radical cation from the reducing agent Fe3+ at the POX site is essential for conversion of tyrosine-385 to its radical form. Paracetamol acts as a reducing cosubstrate on the POX site and lessens availability of the ferryl protoporphyrin IX radical cation. This effect can be reduced in the presence of hydroperoxide-generating lipoxygenase enzymes within the cell (peroxide tone) or by swamping the POX site with substrate such as PGG2. Peroxide tone and swamping explain lack of peripheral analgesic effect, platelet effect, and anti-inflammatory effect by paracetamol. Alternatively, paracetamol effects may be mediated by an active metabolite (p-aminophenol). p-Aminophenol is conjugated with arachidonic acid by fatty acid amide hydrolase to form AM404. AM404 exerts effect through cannabinoid receptors. It may also work through PGHS, particularly in areas of the brain with high concentrations of fatty acid amide hydrolase.},

Using an isogenic murine model, we examined the effects of perinatal exposure through maternal diet to 50 ng (n=20), 50 {$\mu$}g (n=21), or 50 mg (n=18) BPA/kg diet, as well as controls (n=20) on offspring energy expenditure, spontaneous activity, and body composition at 3, 6, and 9 mo of age, and hormone levels at 9 and 10 mo of age. Overall, exposed females and males exhibited increased energy expenditure (P{$<$}0.001 and 0.001, respectively) throughout the life course. In females, horizontal and vertical activity increased (P=0.07 and 0.06, respectively) throughout the life course. Generally, body composition measures were not different throughout the life course in exposed females or males (all P{$>$}0.44), although body fat and weight decreased in exposed females at particular ages (all P{$<$}0.08). Milligram-exposed females had improved glucose, insulin, adiponectin, and leptin profiles (all P{$<$}0.10). Thus, life-course analysis illustrates that BPA is associated with hyperactive and lean phenotypes. Variability across studies may be attributable to differential exposure duration and timing, dietary fat and phytoestrogen content, or lack of sophisticated phenotyping across the life course.\textemdash Anderson, O.S., Peterson, K.E., Sanchez, B.N., Zhang, Z., Mancuso, P., Dolinoy, D.C.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia contributes significantly to pregnancy-associated morbidity and mortality as well as future risk of cardiovascular disease in mother and offspring, and preeclampsia in offspring. The lack of reliable methods for early detection limits the opportunities for prevention, diagnosis, and timely treatment. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore distinct DNA methylation patterns associated with preeclampsia in both maternal cells and fetal-derived tissue that represent potential biomarkers to predict future preeclampsia and inheritance in children. METHOD: A convenience sample of nulliparous women (N = 55) in the first trimester of pregnancy was recruited for this prospective study. Genome-wide DNA methylation was quantified in first-trimester maternal peripheral white blood cells and placental chorionic tissue from normotensive women and those with preeclampsia (n = 6/group). RESULTS: Late-onset preeclampsia developed in 12.7\% of women. Significant differences in DNA methylation were identified in 207 individual linked cytosine and guanine (CpG) sites in maternal white blood cells collected in the first trimester (132 sites with gain and 75 sites with loss of methylation), which were common to approximately 75\% of the differentially methylated CpG sites identified in chorionic tissue of fetal origin. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to identify maternal epigenetic targets and common targets in fetal-derived tissue that represent putative biomarkers for early detection and heritable risk of preeclampsia. Findings may pave the way for diagnosis of preeclampsia prior to its clinical presentation and acute damaging effects, and the potential for prevention of the detrimental long-term sequelae.},

  abstract = {Hybrid phenotypes that contribute to postzygotic reproductive isolation often exhibit pronounced asymmetry, both between reciprocal crosses and between the sexes in accordance with Haldane's rule. Inviability in mammalian hybrids is associated with parent-of-origin placental growth abnormalities for which misregulation of imprinted gene (IGs) is the leading candidate mechanism. However, direct evidence for the involvement of IGs in hybrid growth dysplasia is limited. We used transcriptome and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing to conduct the first genome-scale assessment of the contribution of IGs to parent-of-origin placental growth dysplasia in the cross between the house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus) and the Algerian mouse (Mus spretus). IGs with transgressive expression and methylation were concentrated in the Kcnq1 cluster, which contains causal genes for prenatal growth abnormalities in mice and humans. Hypermethylation of the cluster's imprinting control region, and consequent misexpression of the genes Phlda2 and Ascl2, is a strong candidate mechanism for transgressive placental undergrowth. Transgressive placental and gene regulatory phenotypes, including expression and methylation in the Kcnq1 cluster, were more extreme in hybrid males. Although consistent with Haldane's rule, male-biased defects are unexpected in rodent placenta because the X-chromosome is effectively hemizygous in both sexes. In search of an explanation, we found evidence of leaky imprinted (paternal) X-chromosome inactivation in hybrid female placenta, an epigenetic disturbance that may buffer females from the effects of X-linked incompatibilities to which males are fully exposed. Sex differences in chromatin structure on the X and sex-biased maternal effects are nonmutually exclusive alternative explanations for adherence to Haldane's rule in hybrid placenta. The results of this study contribute to understanding the genetic basis of hybrid inviability in mammals, and the role of IGs in speciation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic gene regulatory mechanism; disruption of this process during early embryonic development can have major consequences on both fetal and placental development. The periconceptional period and intrauterine life are crucial for determining long-term susceptibility to diseases. Treatments and procedures in assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and adverse in-utero environments may modify the methylation levels of genomic imprinting regions, including insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2)/H19, mesoderm-specific transcript (MEST), and paternally expressed gene 10 (PEG10), affecting the development of the fetus. ART, maternal psychological stress, and gestational exposures to chemicals are common stressors suspected to alter global epigenetic patterns including imprinted genes. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: Our objective is to highlight the effect of conception mode and maternal psychological stress on fetal development. Specifically, we monitor fetal programming, regulation of imprinted genes, fetal growth, and long-term disease risk, using the imprinted genes IGF2/H19, MEST, and PEG10 as examples. The possible role of environmental chemicals in genomic imprinting is also discussed. SEARCH METHODS: A PubMed search of articles published mostly from 2005 to 2019 was conducted using search terms IGF2/H19, MEST, PEG10, imprinted genes, DNA methylation, gene expression, and imprinting disorders (IDs). Studies focusing on maternal prenatal stress, psychological well-being, environmental chemicals, ART, and placental/fetal development were evaluated and included in this review. OUTCOMES: IGF2/H19, MEST, and PEG10 imprinted genes have a broad developmental effect on fetal growth and birth weight variation. Their disruption is linked to pregnancy complications, metabolic disorders, cognitive impairment, and cancer. Adverse early environment has a major impact on the developing fetus, affecting mostly growth, the structure, and subsequent function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and neurodevelopment. Extensive evidence suggests that the gestational environment has an impact on epigenetic patterns including imprinting, which can lead to adverse long-term outcomes in the offspring. Environmental stressors such as maternal prenatal psychological stress have been found to associate with altered DNA methylation patterns in placenta and to affect fetal development. Studies conducted during the past decades have suggested that ART pregnancies are at a higher risk for a number of complications such as birth defects and IDs. ART procedures involve multiple steps that are conducted during critical windows for imprinting establishment and maintenance, necessitating long-term evaluation of children conceived through ART. Exposure to environmental chemicals can affect placental imprinting and fetal growth both in humans and in experimental animals. Therefore, their role in imprinting should be better elucidated, considering the ubiquitous exposure to these chemicals. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Dysregulation of imprinted genes is a plausible mechanism linking stressors such as maternal psychological stress, conception using ART, and chemical exposures with fetal growth. It is expected that a greater understanding of the role of imprinted genes and their regulation in fetal development will provide insights for clinical prevention and management of growth and IDs. In a broader context, evidence connecting impaired imprinted gene function to common diseases such as cancer is increasing. This implies early regulation of imprinting may enable control of long-term human health, reducing the burden of disease in the population in years to come.},

In the healthy lung, several physiologic and metabolic factors exhibit disparity when comparing the upper lobe of the lung to lower lobe, including differences in oxygenation, ventilation, lymphatic flow, pH, and blood flow. In this study, we asked whether these regional differences in the lung are associated with DNA methylation changes in lung macrophages that could potentially lead to altered cell responsiveness upon subsequent environmental challenge. All analyses were performed using primary lung macrophages collected via bronchoalveolar lavage from healthy human subjects with normal pulmonary function. Epigenome-wide DNA methylation was examined via Infinium MethylationEPIC (850K) array and validated by targeted next-generation bisulfite sequencing. We observed 95 CpG loci with significant differential methylation in lung macrophages, comparing upper lobe to lower lobe (all false discovery rate , 0.05). Several of these genes, including CLIP4, HSH2D, NR4A1, SNX10, and TYK2, have been implicated as participants in inflammatory/immune-related biological processes. Functionally, we identified phenotypic differences in oxygen use, comparing upper versus lower lung macrophages. Our results support a hypothesis that epigenetic changes, specifically DNA methylation, at a multitude of gene loci in lung macrophages are associated with metabolic differences regionally in lung.

Design We used logistic regression models to study the relationship between sociodemographic variables and self-reported smoking and misclassification (self-reported non-smokers with UC {$>$}50 ng/ml). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to calculate the optimal cut-off point for discriminating smokers. The cut-offs were also calculated after stratification among non-smokers by the number of sources of SHS exposure. The cut-off points used to discriminate smoking status were the level of UC given by Youden's index and for 50 and 100 ng/ml for daily smokers, or 25 and 50 ng/ml for occasional smokers. Participants At the third trimester of pregnancy, 2263 pregnant women of the INMA Project were interviewed between 2004 and 2008 and a urine sample was collected. Results Prevalence of self-reported smokers at the third trimester of pregnancy was 18.5\%, and another 3.9\% misreported their smoking status. Variables associated with self-reported smoking and misreporting were similar, including born in Europe, educational level and exposure to SHS. The optimal cut-off was 82 ng/ml (95\% CI 42 to 133), sensitivity 95.2\% and specificity 96.6\%. The area under the ROC curve was 0.986 (95\% CI 0.982 to 0.990). The cut-offs varied according to the SHS exposure level being 42 (95\% CI 27 to 57), 82 (95\% CI 46 to 136) and 106 ng/ml (95\% CI 58 to 227) for not being SHS exposed, exposed to one, and to two or more sources of SHS, respectively. The optimal cut-off for discriminating occasional smokers from non-smokers was 27 ng/ml (95\% CI 11 to 43). Conclusions Prevalence of smoking during pregnancy in Spain remains high. UC is a reliable biomarker for classifying pregnant women according to their smoking status. However, cut-offs would differ based on baseline exposure to SHS.},

Two studies investigating the effect of the antibacterial compound triclosan on thyroxine (T4) levels in rats are reported. In the first, Wistar rat dams were gavaged with 75, 150 or 300 mg triclosan/kg bw/day throughout gestation and lactation. Total T4 serum levels were measured in dams and offspring, and all doses of triclosan significantly lowered T4 in dams, but no significant effects on T4 levels were seen in the offspring at the end of the lactation period. Since this lack of effect could be due to minimal exposure through maternal milk, a second study using direct per oral pup exposure from postnatal day 3\textendash 16 to 50 or 150 mg triclosan/kg bw/day was performed. This exposure pointed to significant T4 reductions in 16 day old offspring in both dose groups. These results corroborate previous studies showing that in rats lactational transfer of triclosan seems limited. Since an optimal study design for testing potential developmental neurotoxicants in rats, should include exposure during both the pre- and postnatal periods of brain development, we suggest that in the case of triclosan, direct dosing of pups may be the best way to obtain that goal.},

However, the biomonitoring of direct exposure reflection for fetuses are rare. In this study, we determine the concentrations of TCS and TCC in paired maternal serum, cord serum, maternal urine, and amniotic fluid samples collected from a cohort of 95 expecting mother-fetal pairs in Southern China. TCS and TCC are detected widely (detection rates: {$>$}76.9\%) in maternal serum, cord serum, maternal urine, and amniotic fluid samples. TCS is found to be the predominant antimicrobial agent with median concentrations in maternal serum (1.5~ng/mL) and cord serum (1.8~ng/mL) that are one order of magnitude higher than those of tcc in maternal serum (0.085~ng/mL) and cord serum (0.052~ng/mL), respectively. Cord serum concentrations of tcs and tcc correlated well with the concentrations in maternal serum, which reflect the mothers' contribution to fetal exposure. The higher median ratio of cord serum/maternal serumTCS (0.95) compared to that of cord serum/maternal serumTCC (0.53) indicates high placental transmission ability of TCS. Moreover, the facility to penetrate the placental barrier and hard to depurate characteristics lead to the long residence of TCS in the fetal environment, causing great concern over the prenatal exposure risks during the critical window of fetal development. This study provides a novel contribution by increasing existing knowledge on the exposure assessment of TCS and TCC during pregnancy through the exploration of matched maternal-fetal samples.},

However, patients have an increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus type 2 later in life. Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus 1 is caused by overexpression of the maternally imprinted genes PLAGL1 and HYMAI on chromosome 6q24. One of the mechanisms leading to overexpression of the locus is hypomethylation of the maternal allele of PLAGL1 and HYMAI. A subset of patients with maternal hypomethylation at PLAGL1 have hypomethylation at additional imprinted loci throughout the genome, including GRB10, ZIM2 (PEG3), MEST (PEG1), KCNQ1OT1 and NESPAS (GNAS-AS1). About half of the TNDM1 patients carry mutations in ZFP57, a transcription factor involved in establishment and maintenance of methylation of imprinted loci. Our objective was to investigate whether additional regions are aberrantly methylated in ZFP57 mutation carriers.},

  abstract = {Background Parabens, which are used as a preservative in foods and personal care products, are detected in nearly 100\% of human urine samples. Exposure to parabens is associated with DNA damage, male infertility, and endocrine disruption in adults, but the effects of prenatal exposure are unclear. In part, this is due to inadequate assessment of exposure in maternal urine, which may only reflect maternal rather than fetal exposure. To address this gap, we examined the association of prenatal methylparaben measured in meconium with preterm birth, gestational age, birthweight, maternal thyroid hormones, and child Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) at 6\textendash 7~years. Design Data come from the GESTation and the Environment (GESTE) prospective observational pregnancy cohort in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada. Participants were 345 children with data on ADHD among 394 eligible pregnancies in women age {$\geq$}18~years with no known thyroid disease before pregnancy and meconium collected at delivery. Methylparaben was measured in meconium. Birthweight, gestational age, and maternal thyroid hormones at {$<$}20~weeks gestation were measured at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke. Preterm birth was defined as vaginal birth before the 37th week of gestation. Physician diagnosis of ADHD was determined at a scheduled cohort follow-up when children were 6\textendash 7~years old or from medical records. Associations between meconium methylparaben and outcomes were estimated with logistic and linear regressions weighted on the inverse probability of exposure to account for potential confounders, including child sex, familial income, maternal education, pre-pregnancy body mass index, age, and smoking and alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Results Methylparaben was detected in 65 meconium samples (19\%), 33 children were diagnosed with ADHD (10\%), and 13 children were born preterm (4\%). Meconium methylparaben was associated with preterm birth (odds ratio [OR]~=~4.81; 95\% CI [2.29, 10.10]), decreased gestational age (beta [{$\beta$}]~=~-0.61~weeks; 95\% CI [-0.93, -0.29]) and birthweight ({$\beta~$}=~-0.12~kg; 95\% CI [-0.21, -0.03]), altered maternal TSH (relative concentration [RC]~=~0.76; 95\% CI [0.58, 0.99]), total T3 (RC~=~0.84; 95\% CI [0.75, 0.96]) and total T4 (RC~=~1.10; 95\% CI [1.01, 1.19]), maternal hypothyroxinemia (OR~=~2.50, 95\% CI [1.01, 6.22]), and child ADHD at age of 6\textendash 7 (OR~=~2.33, 95\% CI [1.45, 3.76]). The effect of meconium methylparaben on ADHD was partially mediated by preterm birth (20\% mediation) and birthweight (13\% mediation). Conclusions Meconium methylparaben was associated with preterm birth, decreased gestational age and birthweight, maternal thyroid hormone dysfunction, and child ADHD. Parabens are a substantial health concern if causally related to these adverse outcomes.},

HSPs are overexpressed in cancer cells and play roles in their apoptosis, invasion, proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. The regulation or translational modification of HSPs is recognized as a therapeutic target for the development of anticancer drugs. Among the regulatory processes associated with HSP expression, the epigenetic machinery (miRNAs, histone modification, and DNA methylation) has key functions in cancer. Moreover, various epigenetic modifiers of HSP expression have also been reported as therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers of cancer. Thus, in this review, we describe the epigenetic alterations of HSP expression in cancer cells and suggest that HSPs be clinically applied as diagnostic and therapeutic markers in cancer therapy via controlled epigenetic modifiers.},

Objective The objective of this study was to describe these parameters in a well-characterised, prospective birth cohort. Methods Data were drawn from the MotherToBaby study of pregnant women enrolled from 2004 to 2018. Daily acetaminophen diaries were calculated for all exposed women with complete dose and duration information. Descriptive statistics were used to assess maternal characteristics associated with acetaminophen use. Prevalence by 2-year interval was described, and linear regression was used to test for trend. Indication of use and dose per indication were summarised. Results Of 2441 subjects, 1515 (62\%) reported use of acetaminophen. Over the 15-year period, there was a decline in use of 2.5\% for each 2-year period (test for trend = 0.001) with 58\% reporting acetaminophen use in 2017-2018. Among women with acetaminophen use in pregnancy (n = 1515), 58\% reported {$<$}10 days of use, 13\% reported 10-19 days of use, 9\% reported 20-44 days of use, and 9\% reported 45 or more days of use. Twelve per cent had undefined duration of use. Increasing duration of exposure was associated with tobacco use, obesity, self-reported depression or anxiety, and antidepressant use. The most frequently reported indication was headache, however, indication varied by duration of use, with more women reporting use for sleep or pain/injury in the categories with the longest duration of use. Median dose per exposed day was highest among those reporting use for sleep, and higher doses were more frequently reported for arthritis, injury, and pain. Conclusion Acetaminophen is used by the majority of pregnant women, and some continue to use for many weeks in pregnancy. Given the heterogeneity in duration of use, indication, and dose, studies that estimate the risk of adverse outcomes associated with acetaminophen must carefully consider these factors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The deleterious biological effects of low-level, long-term exposure to heavy metals are well known, and children are the most susceptible population. Dabaoshan Mine in the southeast of Guangdong Province is at high risk of discharging multi-metals pollutants into a local river (Hengshihe) and the surrounding area. The present study aimed to estimate relationships between measured multi-metal exposures and the presence of behavioural problems for the school-aged children in the polluted area. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed. Children aged 7-16 years living in three villages of the Hengshihe area with different degrees of heavy-metal pollution participated in this study. Local environmental samples (water and crops) and children's hair were collected, and concentrations of heavy metals were determined. The Child Behaviour Check-list (CBCL) was used to assess the presence of behaviour problems. General linear regression was used to analyze the contribution of hair metals to each CBCL subscale with adjustment for socio-demographic confounding factors. RESULTS: Multiple regression analyses revealed significant effects of hair lead, cadmium and zinc levels on CBCL subscales. Log-transformed hair lead, cadmium and zinc levels accounted for an incremental of 8\% to 15\% variance in anxious/depressed, withdrawn, somatic complaints, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, delinquent behaviour and aggressive behaviour. The concurrent log-transformed hair lead and zinc levels were strongly associated with all subscales while the concurrent log-transformed hair cadmium was only significantly associated with withdrawn, social problems and attention problems. CONCLUSION: This study reveals that heavy metal exposure was associated with increased risk of behavioral problems for school-aged children.},

  abstract = {Objective A systematic review and a meta-analysis were carried out in order to summarize the current published studies and to evaluate LINE-1 hypomethylation in blood and other tissues as an epigenetic marker for cancer risk. Methods A systematic literature search in the Medline database, using PubMed, was conducted for epidemiological studies, published before March 2014. The random-effects model was used to estimate weighted mean differences (MDs) with 95\% Confidence Intervals (CIs). Furthermore, subgroup analyses were conducted by sample type (tissue or blood samples), cancer types, and by assays used to measure global DNA methylation levels. The Cochrane software package Review Manager 5.2 was used. Results A total of 19 unique articles on 6107 samples (2554 from cancer patients and 3553 control samples) were included in the meta-analysis. LINE-1 methylation levels were significantly lower in cancer patients than in controls (MD: -6.40, 95\% CI: -7.71, -5.09; p{$<$}0.001). The significant difference in methylation levels was confirmed in tissue samples (MD -7.55; 95\% CI: -9.14, -65.95; p{$<$}0.001), but not in blood samples (MD: -0.26, 95\% CI: -0.69, 0.17; p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.23). LINE-1 methylation levels were significantly lower in colorectal and gastric cancer patients than in controls (MD: -8.33; 95\% CI: -10.56, -6.10; p{$<$}0.001 and MD: -5.75; 95\% CI: -7.75, -3.74; p{$<$}0.001) whereas, no significant difference was observed for hepatocellular cancer. Conclusions The present meta-analysis adds new evidence to the growing literature on the role of LINE-1 hypomethylation in human cancer and demonstrates that LINE-1 methylation levels were significantly lower in cancer patients than in control samples, especially in certain cancer types. This result was confirmed in tissue samples, both fresh/frozen or FFPE specimens, but not in blood. Further studies are needed to better clarify the role of LINE-1 methylation in specific subgroups, considering both cancer and sample type, and the methods of measurement.},

This does not provide a secure basis for prevention of the disease. Geographical studies gave the first clue that the disease originates during intra-uterine development. Variations in mortality from the disease across England and Wales were shown to correlate closely with past differences in death rates among newborn babies. In the past most deaths among newborns were attributed to low birthweight. This led to the hypothesis that undernutrition in utero permanently changes the body's structure, function and metabolism in ways that lead to coronary heart disease in later life. The association between low birthweight and coronary heart disease has been confirmed in longitudinal studies of men and women around the world. The developmental model of the origins of the disease offers a new way forward.},

These associations have been extensively replicated in studies in different countries and are not the result of confounding variables. They extend across the normal range of birthweight and depend on lower birthweights in relation to the duration of gestation rather than the effects of premature birth. The associations are thought to be consequences of developmental plasticity, the phenomenon by which one genotype can give rise to a range of different physiological or morphological states in response to different environmental conditions during development. Recent observations have shown that impaired growth in infancy and rapid childhood weight gain exacerbate the effects of impaired prenatal growth. A new vision of optimal early human development is emerging which takes account of both short and long-term outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background There is growing interest in examining the simultaneous effects of multiple exposures and, more generally, the effects of mixtures of exposures, as part of the exposome concept (being defined as the totality of human environmental exposures from conception onwards). Uncovering such combined effects is challenging owing to the large number of exposures, several of them being highly correlated. We performed a simulation study in an exposome context to compare the performance of several statistical methods that have been proposed to detect statistical interactions. Methods Simulations were based on an exposome including 237 exposures with a realistic correlation structure. We considered several statistical regression-based methods, including two-step Environment-Wide Association Study (EWAS2), the Deletion/Substitution/Addition (DSA) algorithm, the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Group-Lasso INTERaction-NET (GLINTERNET), a three-step method based on regression trees and finally Boosted Regression Trees (BRT). We assessed the performance of each method in terms of model size, predictive ability, sensitivity and false discovery rate. Results GLINTERNET and DSA had better overall performance than the other methods, with GLINTERNET having better properties in terms of selecting the true predictors (sensitivity) and of predictive ability, while DSA had a lower number of false positives. In terms of ability to capture interaction terms, GLINTERNET and DSA had again the best performances, with the same trade-off between sensitivity and false discovery proportion. When GLINTERNET and DSA failed to select an exposure truly associated with the outcome, they tended to select a highly correlated one. When interactions were not present in the data, using variable selection methods that allowed for interactions had only slight costs in performance compared to methods that only searched for main effects. Conclusions GLINTERNET and DSA provided better performance in detecting two-way interactions, compared to other existing methods.

However, impacts of low levels of BPA exposure on placental developmental processes such as first trimester trophoblast cell growth, angiogenesis and epigenetic modifications are not well studied. Low concentration of BPA (1\,nM) affected cell proliferation of human placental first trimester trophoblasts using a model cell, HTR8/SVneo. BPA abolished both basal- and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-stimulated tube formation in these cells. BPA significantly down regulated mRNA expression of VEGF, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 with concomitant upregulation of 11-{$\beta$}-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 mRNA and protein expression in HTR8/SVneo cells. BPA also lowered CpG methylation of gene promoter associated with metabolic and oxidative stress. This study demonstrated that BPA at 1\,nM not only affected cellular growth, development and angiogenic activities but also affected DNA methylation of stress response and down-regulation of angiogenic growth factors in first trimester trophoblast cells.},

  abstract = {Pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib (PHP-Ib) is a paternally imprinted disorder which maps to a region on chromosome 20q13.3 that comprises GNAS1 at its telomeric boundary. Exon A/B of this gene was recently shown to display a loss of methylation in several PHP-Ib patients. In nine unrelated PHP-Ib kindreds, in whom haplotype analysis and mode of inheritance provided no evidence against linkage to this chromosomal region, we confirmed lack of exon A/B methylation for affected individuals, while unaffected carriers showed no epigenetic abnormality at this locus. However, affected individuals in one kindred (Y2) displayed additional methylation defects involving exons NESP55, AS and XL, and unaffected carriers in this family showed an abnormal methylation at exon NESP55, but not at other exons. Taken together, current evidence thus suggests that distinct mutations within or close to GNAS1 can lead to PHP-Ib and the associated epigenetic changes. To further delineate the telomeric boundary of the PHP-Ib locus, the previously reported kindred F, in which patient F-V/51 is recombinant within GNAS1, was investigated with several new markers and direct nucleotide sequence analysis. These studies revealed that F-V/51 remains recombinant at a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located 1.2 kb upstream of XL. No heterozygous mutation was identified between exon XL and an SNP approximately 8 kb upstream of NESP55, where this affected individual becomes linked, suggesting that the genetic defect responsible for parathyroid hormone resistance in kindred F, and probably other PHP-Ib patients, is located {$>$}or=56 kb centromeric of the abnormally methylated exon A/B. A region upstream of the known coding exons of GNAS1 is therefore predicted to exert, presumably through imprinting of exon A/B, long-range effects on G(s)alpha expression.},

  abstract = {The currently estimated number of genes in the human genome is much smaller than previously predicted. As an explanation for this disparity, most individual genes have multiple transcriptional units that represent a variety of biologically important gene products. GNAS exemplifies a gene of such complexity. One of its products is the {$\alpha$}-subunit of the stimulatory heterotrimeric G protein (Gs{$\alpha$}), a ubiquitous signaling protein essential for numerous different cellular responses. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations within Gs{$\alpha$}-coding GNAS exons are found in various human disorders, including Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy, pseudohypoparathyroidism, fibrous dysplasia of bone, and some tumors of different origin. While Gs{$\alpha$} expression in most tissues is biallelic, paternal Gs{$\alpha$} expression is silenced in a small number of tissues, playing an important role in the development of phenotypes associated with GNAS mutations. Additional products derived exclusively from the paternal GNAS allele include XL{$\alpha$}s, a protein partially identical to Gs{$\alpha$}, and two non-coding RNA molecules, the A/B transcript and the antisense transcript. The maternal GNAS allele leads to NESP55, a chromogranin-like neuroendocrine secretory protein. In vivo animal models have demonstrated the importance of each of the exclusively imprinted GNAS products in normal mammalian physiology. However, although one or more of these products are also disrupted by most naturally occurring GNAS mutations, their roles in disease pathogenesis remain unknown. To further our understanding of the significance of this gene in physiology and pathophysiology, it will be important to elucidate the cellular roles and the mechanisms regulating the expression of each GNAS product.},

  abstract = {Environmental epidemiologic studies are often hierarchical in nature if they estimate individuals' personal exposures using ambient metrics. Local samples are indirect surrogate measures of true local pollutant concentrations which estimate true personal exposures. These ambient metrics include classical-type nondifferential measurement error. The authors simulated subjects' true exposures and their corresponding surrogate exposures as the mean of local samples and assessed the amount of bias attributable to classical and Berkson measurement error on odds ratios, assuming that the logit of risk depends on true individual-level exposure. The authors calibrated surrogate exposures using scalar transformation functions based on observed within- and between-locality variances and compared regression-calibrated results with naive results using surrogate exposures. The authors further assessed the performance of regression calibration in the presence of Berkson-type error. Following calibration, bias due to classical-type measurement error, resulting in as much as 50\% attenuation in naive regression estimates, was eliminated. Berkson-type error appeared to attenuate logistic regression results less than 1\%. This regression calibration method reduces effects of classical measurement error that are typical of epidemiologic studies using multiple local surrogate exposures as indirect surrogate exposures for unobserved individual exposures. Berkson-type error did not alter the performance of regression calibration. This regression calibration method does not require a supplemental validation study to compute an attenuation factor.},

Susceptibility is believed to be the interaction of genetic heritability and environmental factors. The synchronous rises in autism/ASD prevalence and paracetamol (acetaminophen) use, as well as biologic plausibility have led to the hypothesis that paracetamol exposure may increase autism/ASD risk. Methods To explore the relationship of antenatal paracetamol exposure to ASD, population weighted average autism prevalence rates and paracetamol usage rates were compared. To explore the relationship of early neonatal paracetamol exposure to autism/ASD, population weighted average male autism prevalence rates for all available countries and U.S. states were compared to male circumcision rates \textendash{} a procedure for which paracetamol has been widely prescribed since the mid-1990s. Prevalence studies were extracted from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Summary of Autism/ASD Prevalence Studies database. Maternal paracetamol usage and circumcision rates were identified by searches on Pub Med. Results Using all available country-level data (n\,=\,8) for the period 1984 to 2005, prenatal use of paracetamol was correlated with autism/ASD prevalence (r\,=\,0.80). For studies including boys born after 1995, there was a strong correlation between country-level (n\,=\,9) autism/ASD prevalence in males and a country's circumcision rate (r\,=\,0.98). A very similar pattern was seen among U.S. states and when comparing the 3 main racial/ethnic groups in the U.S. The country-level correlation between autism/ASD prevalence in males and paracetamol was considerably weaker before 1995 when the drug became widely used during circumcision. Conclusions This ecological analysis identified country-level correlations between indicators of prenatal and perinatal paracetamol exposure and autism/ASD. State level correlation was also identified for the indicator of perinatal paracetamol exposure and autism/ASD. Like all ecological analyses, these data cannot provide strong evidence of causality. However, biologic plausibility is provided by a growing body of experimental and clinical evidence linking paracetamol metabolism to pathways shown to be important in autism and related developmental abnormalities. Taken together, these ecological findings and mechanistic evidence suggest the need for formal study of the role of paracetamol in autism.},

However, recent studies suggest a possible association between APAP use in pregnancy and offspring neurodevelopment. Objectives To conduct a review of publications reporting associations between prenatal APAP use and offspring neurodevelopmental outcomes. Methods Relevant sources were identified through a key word search of multiple databases (Medline, CINAHL, OVID and TOXNET) in September 2016. All English language observational studies of pregnancy APAP and three classes of neurodevelopmental outcomes (autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and intelligence quotient (IQ)) were included. One reviewer (AZB) independently screened all titles and abstracts, extracted and analyzed the data. Results 64 studies were retrieved and 55 were ineligible. Nine prospective cohort studies fulfilled all inclusion criteria. Data pooling was not appropriate due to heterogeneity in outcomes. All included studies suggested an association between prenatal APAP exposure and the neurodevelopmental outcomes; ADHD, ASD, or lower IQ. Longer duration of APAP use was associated with increased risk. Associations were strongest for hyperactivity and attention-related outcomes. Little modification of associations by indication for use was reported. Conclusions Together, these nine studies suggest an increased risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes following prenatal APAP exposure. Further studies are urgently needed with; precise indication of use and exposure assessment of use both in utero and in early life. Given the current findings, pregnant women should be cautioned against indiscriminate use of APAP. These results have substantial public health implications.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the role of aquaporins (AQPs) in the regulation of amniotic fluid (AF) volume, we determined AF volume and composition and placental and fetal membrane AQP expression throughout the second half of murine gestation. METHODS: Pregnant CD1 mice were sacrificed at e10-19 and AF volume and composition determined. Placenta and fetal membranes were screened for AQP gene expression. AQP gene expression was quantified by real-time RT PCR and protein location determined by immunohistochemistry. Changes in AF volume were correlated with AQP expression. RESULTS: Both membranes and placenta demonstrated expression of AQP1, -3, -8 and -9. Advancing gestation was associated with increased AF volume from e10 to e16, with a marked decrease in AF volume from e16 to e19. By immunohistochemistry, AQP1 was localized to placental vessels and AQP3 to trophoblast. AF volume was negatively correlated with fetal membrane AQP1 and placental AQP1 and AQP9 expression, and positively correlated with placental AQP3 expression. CONCLUSION: Changes in AQPs with advancing gestation, and their correlation with AF volume, suggest a role in mediating placental and membrane water flow and ultimately AF volume. AQP1 appears to regulate fetal membrane water flow, and AQP3 is a likely candidate for the regulation of placental water flow.},

Plots allow the results of the different models to be compared.

  abstract = {The region of the amnion overlying the placenta plays an active role in fluid exchange between amniotic fluid and fetal blood perfusing the surface of the placenta, whereas little transfer occurs across the reflected amnion that contacts the membranous chorion. Because aquaporins (AQPs) facilitate rapid movement of water across cells, we hypothesized that AQP gene expression in placental amnion is higher than in reflected amnion. Furthermore, because gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is often associated with polyhydramnios, we hypothesized that amnion AQP gene expression is reduced when amniotic fluid volume is elevated. Human placental and reflected amnion were obtained at cesarean delivery and subjected to relative quantitation of AQP mRNA by real-time RT-qPCR and proteins by western immunoblot. Amnion mRNA levels of five AQPs differed by up to 400-fold (P~{$<~$}0.001), with AQP1 and AQP3 most abundant, AQP8 least and AQP9 and AQP11 intermediately expressed. Aquaporin proteins showed a similar profile. Aquaporin mRNA abundance was higher (P~{$<~$}0.001) in placental than reflected amnion, whereas protein levels were lower (P~{$<~$}0.01). In GDM pregnancies, neither AQP mRNA nor protein levels were different from normal. There was no correlation between AQP mRNA or protein levels with the amniotic fluid index in normal or GDM subjects. We conclude that there is a strong differential expression profile among individual AQPs and between regions of the amnion. These findings suggest differences in contribution of individual AQPs to water transport in the two regions of the amnion. Furthermore, AQP expression in the amnion is not altered in patients with GDM.},

  abstract = {Aquaporins (AQPs) are water channels that regulate water flow in many tissues. As AQP1 is a candidate to regulate placental fluid exchange, we sought to investigate the effect of arginine vasopressin (AVP) and cAMP agonists on AQP1 gene expression in first trimester-derived extravillous cytotrophoblasts (HTR-8/Svneo) and two highly proliferative carcinoma trophoblast-like cell lines but with a number of functional features of the syncytiotrophoblast namely; JAR and JEG-3 cells. Our data demonstrated that AVP (0.1 nM) significantly increased the expression of AQP1 mRNA at 10 h in HTR-8/SVneo and JEG-3 cells (P{$<$}0.05). Both SP-cAMP, a membrane-permeable and phosphodiesterase resistant cAMP, and forskolin, an adenylate cyclase stimulator significantly increased AQP1 mRNA expression in all cell lines after 2 h in a dose-dependent manner (P{$<$}0.05) with a parallel increase in protein expression. In the time course study, 5 microM of either SP-cAMP or forskolin significantly stimulated AQP1 mRNA expression after 2 h in HTR-8/SVneo cells and after 10 h in JAR and JEG-3 cells. AQP1 protein expression was highest after 20 h in both HTR-8/SVneo and JEG-3 cells (P{$<$}0.05). AVP-stimulated cAMP elevation was blocked in the presence of 9-(tetrahydro-2'-furyl) adenine (SQ22536) (100 microM), a cell-permeable adenylate cyclase inhibitor (P{$<$}0.05). These results indicate that in trophoblasts-like cells AQP1 gene expression is upregulated by both AVP and cAMP agonists. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that a cAMP-dependent pathway is responsible for the AVP effect on AQP1. Thus, modulation of AQP1 expression by maternal hormones may regulate invasion and fetal-placental-amnion water homeostasis during gestation.},

  abstract = {Some have questioned the importance of the small effect sizes generally reported in epidemiological studies of neurotoxicity. To some extent, this reflects a failure to appreciate the critical distinction between individual and population risk. In the first part of the paper, arguments are marshaled to support the contention that small shifts in the mean value of a health index within a study sample can, under some circumstances, carry substantial implications for the health status of the population from which the study sample was drawn. Under such circumstances, a populationbased approach to prevention might be as effective as a patient-based approach. The second part clarifies conditions under which this will be true (e.g., a monotonic relationship between a health index and risk of disease) and conditions under which it might not (e.g., a J-shaped relationship). In the third part, the relative levels of uncertainty in characterizing individual versus population risk are explored. In neurotoxicological studies, uncertainty in characterizing individual risk could be reduced by adjusting, in addition to bone fide confounders, for covariates that are strong predictors of outcome and by more assiduous efforts to characterize major effect modifiers.},

With regard to validity, the critical issues pertain to the appropriate strategy for confounder adjustment, particularly when confounders are complex, multi-faceted constructs, and to the need for greater clarity and transparency in articulating the causal relationships implicit in the analytic approach applied. With regard to precision, the critical issue is a need to identify the contributors to the substantial variability observed in the effect estimates that describe dose-response and dose-effect relationships. In addition to methodological sources, such as imprecision in estimating dose at the critical organ site(s), true inter-individual differences in susceptibility to a neurotoxicant could also contribute to the variability. Variability might be reduced by taking full account of factors such as co-exposures or health co-morbidities, genetic polymorphisms, and the social ecology of exposure. With regard to interpretation, we need to do a better job as a field conveying to risk assessors and others the ecological significance of the types of performance deficits observed following neurotoxicant exposure, emphasizing the distinction between individual and population risk. A final issue discussed is the need to define standards for the conduct, analysis, and reporting of epidemiologic studies of neurotoxicity, similar to those developed for other fields.},

  abstract = {Background: Studies of early-life neurotoxicant exposure have not been designed, analyzed, or interpreted in the context of a fully developmental perspective. Objectives: The goal of this paper is to describe the key principles of a developmental perspective and to use examples from the literature to illustrate the relevance of these principles to early-life neurotoxicant exposures. Methods: Four principles are discussed: 1) the effects of early-life neurotoxicant exposure depend on a child's developmental context; 2) deficits caused by early-life exposure initiate developmental cascades that can lead to pathologies that differ from those observed initially; 3) early-life neurotoxicant exposure has intra-familial and intergenerational impacts; 4) the impacts of early-life neurotoxicant exposure influence a child's ability to respond to future insults. The first principle is supported by considerable evidence, but the other three have received much less attention. Discussion: Incorporating a developmental perspective in studies of early-life neurotoxicant exposures requires prospective collection of data on a larger array of covariates than usually considered, using analytical approaches that acknowledge the transactional processes between a child and the environment and the phenomenon of developmental cascades. Conclusion: Consideration of early-life neurotoxicant exposure within a developmental perspective reveals that many issues remain to be explicated if we are to achieve a deep understanding of the societal health burden associated with early-life neurotoxicant exposures.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tooth-coloured polymer-based dental filling materials are currently the first choice for dental restorative treatment in many countries. However, there are some concerns about their safety. It has been shown that substances known as endocrine disrupters, which might pass through the placental barrier, are released from these materials within the first hours after curing. Thus, the placement of polymer-based dental fillings in pregnant women may put the vulnerable foetus at risk. Large epidemiological studies exploring the risk of having polymer-based dental materials placed during pregnancy are lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the placement of polymer-based dental fillings during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes. METHODS: This study is based on data from the large Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). The information about dental treatment during pregnancy was obtained from questionnaires sent to the participating women during weeks 17 and 30 of pregnancy. Reported placement of "white fillings" was used as exposure marker for having received polymer-based dental filling materials. Only singleton births were included in the present study. Data were linked to the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. Logistic regression models that included the mother's age, level of education, body mass index, parity, and smoking and alcohol consumption during pregnancy were used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95\% confidence interval (CI). Different adverse birth outcomes were of interest in the present study. RESULTS: Valid data were available from 90,886 pregnancies. Dentist consultation during pregnancy was reported by 33,727 women, 10,972 of whom had white fillings placed. The adjusted logistic regression models showed no statistically significant association between having white dental fillings placed during pregnancy and stillbirth, malformations, preterm births, and low or high birth weight. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, women who reported white fillings placed during pregnancy had no increased risk for adverse birth outcomes compared with women who did not consult a dentist during pregnancy. Thus, our findings do not support the hypothesis of an association between placement of polymer-based fillings during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes.},

Although human and animal studies suggest an association between exposure to phenols and parabens and thyroid hormone levels, few studies have investigated the association of in utero exposure to these chemicals and thyroid hormones in pregnant women and their neonates. We measured four environmental phenols (triclosan, benzophenone-3, and 2,4- and 2,5-dichlorophenol), and three parabens (methyl-, propyl-, and butyl paraben) in urine collected from mothers at two time points during pregnancy as part of the CHAMACOS (Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas) study. We measured free thyroxine (T4), total T4, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in serum of the pregnant women (N = 454) and TSH in their neonates (N = 365). We examined potential confounding by a large number of additional chemical exposures and used Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to select the most influential chemicals to include in regression models. We observed negative associations of prenatal urinary concentrations of propyl paraben and maternal TSH ({$\beta$} for two-fold increase = -3.26\%, 95\% CI: -5.55, -0.90) and negative associations of 2,4-dichlorophenol and maternal free T4 ({$\beta$} for two-fold increase = -0.05, 95\% CI: -0.08, -0.02), after controlling for other chemical exposures. We observed negative associations of triclosan with maternal total T4 after controlling for demographic variables, but this association became non-significant after controlling for other chemicals ({$\beta$} for two-fold increase = -0.05, 95\% CI: -0.11, 0.00). We found evidence that environmental phenols and parabens are associated with lower TSH and free T4 in pregnant women after controlling for related chemical exposures.},

  abstract = {Through DNA methylation, histone modifications, and small regulatory RNAs the epigenome systematically controls gene expression during development-- both in utero and throughout life. The epigenome is also a very reactionary system; its labile nature allows it to sense and respond to environmental perturbations to ensure survival during fetal growth. This pliability can lead to aberrant epigenetic modifications that persist into later life and induce numerous disease states. Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) are ubiquitous chemicals that interfere with growth and development. Several EDCs also interfere with epigenetic programming. The investigation of the epigenotoxic effects of bisphenol A (BPA), an EDC used in the production of plastics and resins, has further raised concern for the impact of EDCs on the epigenome. Using the Agouti viable yellow (Avy) mouse model, dietary BPA exposure was shown to hypomethylate both the Avy and the CabpIAP metastable epialleles. This hypomethylating effect was counteracted with dietary supplementation of methyl donors or genistein. These results are consistent with reports of BPA and other EDCs causing epigenetic effects. Epigenotoxicity could lead to numerous developmental, metabolic, and behavioral disorders in exposed populations. The heritable nature of epigenetic changes also increases the risk for transgenerational inheritance of phenotypes. Thus, epigenotoxicity must be considered when assessing these compounds for safety.},

Although a large amount of research has been devoted to estimation and inference for data with censored responses, very little research has focused on proper statistical procedures when predictors are censored. In this paper, we consider statistical methods for dealing with multiple predictors subject to detection limits within the context of generalized linear models. We investigate and adapt several conventional methods and develop a new multiple imputation approach for analyzing data sets with predictors censored due to detection limits. We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed multiple imputation estimator and suggest a computationally simple and consistent variance estimator. We also demonstrate that the conditional mean imputation method often leads to inconsistent estimates in generalized linear models, while several other methods are either computationally intensive or lead to parameter estimates that are biased or more variable compared to the proposed multiple imputation estimator. In an extensive simulation study, we assess the bias and variability of different approaches within the context of a logistic regression model and compare variance estimation methods for the proposed multiple imputation estimator. Lastly, we apply several methods to analyze the data set from a recently-conducted GenIMS study.},

Method and results: In this study we investigated five ``pure'' groups of patients (865), i.e. each presenting only one of the following risk factors: hypertension, obesity, overweight, smoking, hypercholesterolaemia and a control group of 37 healthy subjects. We measured, both as discrete and as continuous variables, the following indices: intima-media thickening of the common carotid artery (IMTC) and of the common femoral artery (IMTF) and the ankle-brachial index (ABI). Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the prevalence of pathological values for the three indices in the different groups. Subsequently the entire group of 902 subjects was included in a correlation analysis in which the Pearson correlation coefficient for each pair of variables was computed. In order to assign the risk factors a continuous ranking, and obtain a more general idea of the correlation structure, principal component analysis (PCA) was used. The scores obtained from PCA made it possible to build a scale of severity of the vascular risk factors considered. All the risk factors considered were demonstrated to strongly affect the studied indices. Overweight was shown to be the least important risk factor with regard to intima-media thickening, followed by smoking, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension and finally obesity, which emerged as the greatest risk factor. Conclusions: The strong correlation between the indices made it possible to compute a composite general score, which provides an univocal risk estimation at single-patient level. IMTF was demonstrated to be the most sensitive descriptor. The construction of this risk scale has implications for preventive treatment and the frequency of instrumental examinations, allowing clear quantitative definition of the extent of the damage.},

All disease-causing point mutations identified until now in SYNGAP1 are truncating, raising the possibility of an association between this type of mutations and NSID. Here, we report the identification of the first pathogenic missense mutations (c.1084T{$>$}C [p.W362R], c.1685C{$>$}T [p.P562L]) and three novel truncating mutations (c.283dupC [p.H95PfsX5], c.2212\_2213del [p.S738X], and (c.2184del [p.N729TfsX31]) in SYNGAP1 in patients with NSID. A subset of these patients also showed ataxia, autism, and a specific form of generalized epilepsy that can be refractory to treatment. All of these mutations occurred de novo, except c.283dupC, which was inherited from a father who is a mosaic. Biolistic transfection of wild-type SYNGAP1 in pyramidal cells from cortical organotypic cultures significantly reduced activity-dependent phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) levels. In contrast, constructs expressing p.W362R, p.P562L, or the previously described p.R579X had no significant effect on pERK levels. These experiments suggest that the de novo missense mutations, p.R579X, and possibly all the other truncating mutations in SYNGAP1 result in a loss of its function. Moreover, our study confirms the involvement of SYNGAP1 in autism while providing novel insight into the epileptic manifestations associated with its disruption.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Over-the-counter analgesic use during pregnancy, particularly acetaminophen, may be associated with negative developmental outcomes in children. OBJECTIVE: Estimate associations of prenatal and early-life exposure to acetaminophen in early childhood with cognitive, motor, and language skills in two birth cohorts. METHODS: The American Project Viva cohort (1217 mother-child pairs enrolled 1999-2002) assessed cognition at approximately 3~years using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test and the Wide Range Achievement of Visual Motor Abilities (WRAVMA). The Brazilian 2015 Pelotas Birth Cohort (3818 mother-child pairs) assessed cognition at 2~years using the INTERGROWTH-21st Neurodevelopment Assessment. We used linear regression to estimate associations of acetaminophen use during pregnancy (Project Viva and Pelotas) and infancy (Project Viva) with children's cognitive scores adjusted for maternal age, pre-pregnancy body mass index, education, parity, race/ethnicity, smoking and alcohol use during pregnancy, depression during pregnancy, antibiotic and ibuprofen use during pregnancy, household income, and child's sex. RESULTS: In Project Viva, exposure to acetaminophen in both the 1st and 2nd trimester of pregnancy was associated with lower WRAVMA drawing scores ({$\beta$} -1.51, 95\% CI -2.92, -0.10). However, in Pelotas, exposure to acetaminophen in both the 1st and 2nd trimester of pregnancy was not associated with INTER-NDA motor scores ({$\beta$} 0.02; 95\% CI -0.05, 0.09) and was associated with higher INTER-NDA total scores ({$\beta$} 0.08, 95\% CI 0.01, 0.16). Other comparisons did not show evidence for any associations. CONCLUSIONS: Inconsistencies and lack of specificity of the findings did not clarify the research question considering that we still have a large variability and uncertainty to define the risk or safety in the use of acetaminophen related to cognition in early childhood. More studies using better exposure assessment and better confounding variables are needed to clarify these associations.},

Amid a growing focus on ``Big Data,'' it offers epidemiologists new tools to tackle problems for which classical methods are not well-suited. In order to critically evaluate the value of integrating machine learning algorithms and existing methods, however, it is essential to address language and technical barriers between the two fields that can make it difficult for epidemiologists to read and assess machine learning studies. Here, we provide an overview of the concepts and terminology used in machine learning literature, which encompasses a diverse set of tools with goals ranging from prediction to classification to clustering. We provide a brief introduction to 5 common machine learning algorithms and 4 ensemble-based approaches. We then summarize epidemiologic applications of machine learning techniques in the published literature. We recommend approaches to incorporate machine learning in epidemiologic research and discuss opportunities and challenges for integrating machine learning and existing epidemiologic research methods.},

  abstract = {Background: Women of reproductive age can be exposed to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) at work, and exposure to EDCs in pregnancy may affect fetal growth. Objectives: We assessed whether maternal occupational exposure to EDCs during pregnancy as classified by application of a job exposure matrix was associated with birth weight, term low birth weight (LBW), length of gestation, and preterm delivery. Methods: Using individual participant data from 133,957 mother\textendash child pairs in 13 European cohorts spanning births from 1994 through 2011, we linked maternal job titles with exposure to 10 EDC groups as assessed through a job exposure matrix. For each group, we combined the two levels of exposure categories (possible and probable) and compared birth outcomes with the unexposed group (exposure unlikely). We performed meta-analyses of cohort-specific estimates. Results: Eleven percent of pregnant women were classified as exposed to EDCs at work during pregnancy, based on job title. Classification of exposure to one or more EDC group was associated with an increased risk of term LBW [odds ratio (OR) = 1.25; 95\% CI: 1.04, 1.49], as were most specific EDC groups; this association was consistent across cohorts. Further, the risk increased with increasing number of EDC groups (OR = 2.11; 95\% CI: 1.10, 4.06 for exposure to four or more EDC groups). There were few associations (p {$<$} 0.05) with the other outcomes; women holding job titles classified as exposed to bisphenol A or brominated flame retardants were at higher risk for longer length of gestation. Conclusion: Results from our large population-based birth cohort design indicate that employment during pregnancy in occupations classified as possibly or probably exposed to EDCs was associated with an increased risk of term LBW.

  abstract = {Background Pain during pregnancy is common, and its management is complex. Certain analgesics may increase the risk for adverse fetal and pregnancy outcomes, while poorly managed pain can result in adverse maternal outcomes such as depression and hypertension. Guidelines to assist clinicians in assessing risks and benefits of exposure to analgesics for the mother and unborn infant are lacking, necessitating evidence-based recommendations for managing pain in pregnancy. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted to assess pregnancy safety data for pharmacological and nonpharmacological pain management methods. Relevant clinical trials and observational studies were identified using multiple medical databases, and included studies were evaluated for quality and possible biases. Results Paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are appropriate for mild to moderate pain, but NSAIDs should be avoided in the third trimester due to established risks. Short courses of weaker opioids are generally safe in pregnancy, although neonatal abstinence syndrome must be monitored following third trimester exposure. Limited safety data for pregabalin and gabapentin indicate that these are unlikely to be major teratogens, and tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors have limited but overall reassuring safety data. Many of the included studies were limited by methodological issues. Conclusions Findings from this review can guide clinicians in their decision to prescribe analgesics for pregnant women. Treatment should be tailored to the lowest therapeutic dose and shortest possible duration, and management should involve a discussion of risks and benefits and monitoring for response. Further research is required to better understand the safety profile of various analgesics in pregnancy.},

  abstract = {Pre-eclampsia is a serious complication of pregnancy that can affect both maternal and fetal outcomes. Early-onset pre-eclampsia (EOPET) is a severe form of pre-eclampsia that is associated with altered physiological characteristics and gene expression in the placenta. DNA methylation is a relatively stable epigenetic modification to DNA that can reflect gene expression, and can provide insight into the mechanisms underlying such expression changes. This case \textendash control study focused on DNA methylation and gene expression of whole chorionic villi samples from 20 EOPET placentas and 20 gestational age-matched controls from pre-term births. DNA methylation was also assessed in placentas affected by late-onset pre-eclampsia (LOPET) and normotensive intrauterine growth restriction (nIUGR). The Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip was used to assess DNA methylation at .480 000 cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites. The Illumina HT-12v4 Expression BeadChip was used to assess gene expression of .45 000 transcripts in a subset of cases and controls. DNA methylation analysis by pyrosequencing was used to follow-up the initial findings in four genes with a larger cohort of cases and controls, including nIUGR and LOPET placentas. Bioinformatic analysis was used to identify overrepresentation of gene ontology categories and transcription factor binding motifs. We identified 38 840 CpG sites with significant (false discovery rate ,0.01) DNA methylation alterations in EOPET, of which 282 had .12.5\% methylation difference compared with the controls. Significant sites were enriched at the enhancers and low CpG density regions of the associated genes and the majority (74.5\%) of these sites were hypomethylated in EOPET. EOPET, but not associated clinical features, such as intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), presented a distinct DNA methylation profile. CpG sites from four genes relevant to pre-eclampsia (INHBA, BHLHE40, SLC2A1 and ADAM12) showed different extent of changes in LOPET and nIUGR. Genome-wide expression in a subset of samples showed that some of the gene expression changes were negatively correlated with DNA methylation changes, particularly for genes that are responsible for angiogenesis (such as EPAS1 and FLT1). Results could be confounded by altered cell populations in abnormal placentas. Larger sample sizes are needed to fully address the possibility of sub-profiles of methylation within the EOPET cohort. Based on DNA methylation profiling, we conclude that there are widespread DNA methylation alterations in EOPET that may be associated with changes in placental function. This property may provide a useful tool for early screening of such placentas. This study identifies DNA methylation changes at many loci previously reported to have altered gene expression in EOPET placentas, as well as in novel biologically relevant genes we confirmed to be differentially expressed. These results may be useful for DNA- methylation-based non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of at-risk pregnancies.},

The advent of high-throughput (omics) technologies gives opportunities to perform mediation analysis with a high-dimension pool of covariates.Objective:We aimed to highlight some biostatistical issues of this expanding field of high-dimension mediation.Discussion:The mediation techniques used for a single mediator cannot be generalized in a straightforward manner to high-dimension mediation. Causal knowledge on the relation between covariates is required for mediation analysis, and it is expected to be more limited as dimension and system complexity increase. The methods developed in high dimension can be distinguished according to whether mediators are considered separately or as a whole. Methods considering each potential mediator separately do not allow efficient identification of the indirect effects when mutual influences exist among the mediators, which is expected for many biological (e.g., epigenetic) parameters. In this context, methods considering all potential mediators simultaneously, based, for example, on data reduction techniques, are more adapted to the causal inference framework. Their cost is a possible lack of ability to single out the causal mediators. Moreover, the ability of the mediators to predict the outcome can be overestimated, in particular because many machine-learning algorithms are optimized to increase predictive ability rather than their aptitude to make causal inference. Given the lack of overarching validated framework and the generally complex causal structure of high-dimension data, analysis of high-dimension mediation currently requires great caution and effort to incorporate a priori biological knowledge.  https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6240},

However, most health effects studies focus on single agents or consider simple two-way interaction models, in part because we lack the statistical methodology to more realistically capture the complexity of mixed exposures. We introduce Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) as a new approach to study mixtures, in which the health outcome is regressed on a flexible function of the mixture (e.g. air pollution or toxic waste) components that is specified using a kernel function. In high-dimensional settings, a novel hierarchical variable selection approach is incorporated to identify important mixture components and account for the correlated structure of the mixture. Simulation studies demonstrate the success of BKMR in estimating the exposure-response function and in identifying the individual components of the mixture responsible for health effects. We demonstrate the features of the method through epidemiology and toxicology applications.},

  abstract = {In statistical practice, researchers commonly focus on patterns in the means of multiple dependent outcomes while treating variances as nuisance parameters. However, in fact, there are often substantive reasons to expect certain patterns in the variances of dependent outcomes as well. For example, in a repeated measures study, one may expect the variance of the outcome to increase over time if the difference between subjects becomes more pronounced over time because the subjects respond differently to a given treatment. Such expectations can be formulated as order constrained hypotheses on the variances of the dependent outcomes. Currently, however, no methods exist for testing such hypotheses in a direct manner. To fill this gap, we develop a Bayes factor for this challenging testing problem. Our Bayes factor is based on the multivariate normal distribution with an unstructured covariance matrix, which is often used to model dependent outcomes. Order constrained hypotheses can then be formulated on the variances on the diagonal of the covariance matrix. To compute Bayes factors between multiple order constrained hypotheses, a prior distribution needs to be specified under every hypothesis to be tested. Here, we use the encompassing prior approach in which priors under order constrained hypotheses are truncations of the prior under the unconstrained hypothesis. The resulting Bayes factor is fully automatic in the sense that no subjective priors need to be specified by the user.},

  abstract = {In addition to its role in neurotransmission, embryonic serotonin (5-HT) has been implicated in the regulation of neurodevelopmental processes. For example, we recently showed that a subset of 5-HT1-receptors expressed in the fetal forebrain mediate a serotonergic modulation of thalamocortical axons response to axon guidance cues, both in vitro and in vivo. This influence of 5-HT signaling on fetal brain wiring raised important questions regarding the source of the ligand during pregnancy. Until recently, it was thought that 5-HT sources impacting brain development arose from maternal transport to the fetus, or from raphe neurons in the brainstem of the fetus. Using genetic mouse models, we uncovered previously unknown differences in 5-HT accumulation between the fore- and hindbrain during early and late fetal stages, through an exogenous source of 5-HT. Using additional genetic strategies, a new technology for studying placental biology ex vivo, and direct manipulation of placental neosynthesis, we investigated the nature of this exogenous source and uncovered a placental 5-HT synthetic pathway from a maternal tryptophan precursor, in both mice and humans. These results implicate a new, direct role for placental metabolic pathways in modulating fetal brain development and suggest an important role for maternal-placental-fetal interactions and 5-HT in the fetal programming of adult mental disorders.},

Method: A population-based pregnancy cohort study including 754 women who enrolled in the Swedish Environmental Longitudinal, Mother and child, Asthma and allergy (SELMA) study in pregnancy week 8\textendash 13. Two exposure measures were used: (1) maternally reported number of APAP tablets taken between conception and enrollment; (2) APAP urinary concentration at enrollment. Language development at 30 months was assessed by nurse's evaluation and parental questionnaire, including the number of words the child used ({$<$}25, 25\textendash 50 and {$>$}50). Main study outcome; parental report of use of fewer than 50 words, termed language delay (LD). Results: 59.2\% of women enrolled in weeks 8\textendash 13 reported taking APAP between conception and enrollment. APAP was measurable in all urine samples and urinary APAP was correlated with the number of APAP taken during pregnancy (P {$<$} 0.01). Language delay was more prevalent in boys (12.6\%) than girls (4.1\%) (8.5\% in total). Both the number of APAP tablets and urinary APAP concentration were associated with greater LD in girls but not in boys. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for LD among girls whose mothers reported {$>$}6 vs. 0 APAP tablets was 5.92 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.10\textendash 31.94). The OR for LD in girls whose mothers' urinary APAP was in the highest compared to the lowest quartile was 10.34 (95\% CI 1.37\textendash 77.86). While it cannot be ruled out, our available data do not support confounding by indication. Conclusions: Given the prevalence of prenatal APAP use and the importance of language development, these findings, if replicated, would suggest that pregnant women should limit their use of this analgesic during pregnancy.},

METHODS: Eleven phthalate metabolites were quantified in spot maternal urine samples collected during gestation among 520 women of the EDEN mother-child cohort who gave birth to a boy. Fetal growth was assessed from repeated ultrasound measurements and measurements at birth. We used repeated measures of weight and height in the first 5 years of life to model individual postnatal growth trajectories. We estimated adjusted variations in pre and postnatal growth parameters associated with an interquartile range increase in ln-transformed phthalate metabolite concentrations. RESULTS: Monocarboxyisononyl phthalate (MCNP) was positively associated with femoral length during gestation and length at birth. High molecular weight phthalate metabolites were negatively associated with estimated fetal weight throughout pregnancy. Monoethyl phthalate (MEP) showed positive association with weight growth velocity from two to five years and with body mass index at five years ({$\beta$}=0.17kg/m2, 95\% confidence interval, 0.04, 0.30). CONCLUSIONS: We highlighted associations between gestational exposure to some phthalates and growth in boys. The positive association between MEP and postnatal growth in boys was also reported in several previous human studies.},

The utility of quantitative methylation assays at imprinted genes for the diagnosis of fetal and placental disorders. An imbalance of imprinted gene expression within 11p15.5 is observed in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), as well as in a variety of placental abnormalities including complete hydatidiform mole (CHM), placental mesenchymal dysplasia (PMD) and triploidy. To facilitate the diagnosis of epigenetic errors and chromosomal imbalance of 11p15.5, we validated a pyrosequencing assay to measure methylation at KvDMR1 using blood samples from 13 BWS cases, 8 of which showed reduced methylation as compared to control blood. An imbalance between maternal and paternal genomes as is found in triploidy, CHM or PMD was also associated with altered KvDMR1 methylation. A reciprocal pattern of methylation was obtained in the triploid cases by assaying the proximal 11p15.5 ICR associated with H19. To distinguish chromosome 11 specific alterations from whole genome imbalance, other imprinted differentially methylated regions (DMRs) can be utilized. Thus, pyrosequencing assays for DMRs associated with SGCE, SNRPN, and MEST were also compared for their utility in diagnosing parental imbalance in placental samples. While each of these assays could successfully distinguish parental origin of triploidy, SGCE showed the clearest separation between groups. The combined use of a chromosome 11p15.5 assay (e.g. KvDMR1 or H19-ICR) and non-chromosome 11 assay (e.g. SGCE) provides a potentially valuable diagnostic tool in the rapid screening of methylation errors in placental disorders. These results also show the maintenance of imprinting status at these loci in the human placenta, even in the presence of abnormal pathology.},

  abstract = {Phthalates are a class of endocrine disrupting chemicals with near ubiquitous exposure to populations around the world. Phthalates have been associated with children's adiposity in previous studies, though discrepancies exist across studies that may be due to timing of exposure or outcome assessment and population differences (i.e., genetics, other confounders). DNA methylation, an epigenetic modification involved in gene regulation, may mediate the effects of early life phthalate exposures on health outcomes. This study aims to evaluate the mediating effect of DNA methylation at growth-related genes on the association between phthalate exposure and repeat measures of adiposity (BMI-for-age z-score, waist circumference, and skinfolds thickness) in Mexican children. Urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations were quantified in mothers at each of the three trimesters of pregnancy and in children at the first peri-adolescent study visit. Blood leukocyte DNA methylation at H19 and HSD11B2 was quantified during the first peri-adolescent visit, and adiposity was measured at the first visit and again \textasciitilde 3 years later among participants (n = 109 boys, 114 girls) from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) project. Associations between phthalates or DNA methylation and repeat outcome measures were assessed separately in boys and girls using generalized estimating equation models including covariates (urinary specific gravity, maternal education, and child's age). Sobel tests were used to assess DNA methylation as a mediator in models adjusting for the same covariates. Associations between phthalates and adiposity varied by phthalate and timing of exposure. Early gestation MBP, MIBP, and MBzP were associated with adiposity among girls. For example, among girls first trimester maternal urine concentrations of MIBP were associated with increases in skinfold thickness, BMI-for-age, and waist circumference (p {$<$} 0.01). Second trimester and adolescent MBzP were associated with adiposity among boys in opposite directions. In girls, H19 methylation was positively associated with skinfold thickness. No significant mediation of phthalate exposure on adiposity by DNA methylation of H19 or HSD11B2 was observed (Sobel p {$>$} 0.05). However, the mediation analysis was underpowered to detect small to medium effect sizes, and the role of DNA methylation as a mediator between phthalates and outcomes merits further study.},

The top DMP was located in SLC7A11A, a gene involved in cystine/glutamate transport and the biosynthesis of glutathione, an antioxidant that may protect against As-induced oxidative stress. Additional DMPs were located in genes associated with tumor development and glucose metabolism.

Method Between 1999 and 2008 all pregnant Norwegian women were eligible for recruitment into the prospective Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. The mothers were asked to report on their use of paracetamol at gestational weeks 17 and 30 and at 6 months postpartum. We used data on 48 631 children whose mothers returned the 3-year follow-up questionnaire by May 2011. Within this sample were 2919 same-sex sibling pairs who were used to adjust for familial and genetic factors. We modelled psychomotor development (communication, fine and gross motor development), externalizing and internalizing behaviour problems, and temperament (emotionality, activity, sociability and shyness) based on prenatal paracetamol exposure using generalized linear regression, adjusting for a number of factors, including febrile illness, infections and co-medication use during pregnancy. Results The sibling-control analysis revealed that children exposed to prenatal paracetamol for more than 28 days had poorer gross motor development [b 0.24, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.12\textendash 0.51], communication (b 0.20, 95\% CI 0.01\textendash 0.39), externalizing behaviour (b 0.28, 95\% CI 0.15\textendash 0.42), internalizing behaviour (b 0.14, 95\% CI 0.01\textendash 0.28), and higher activity levels (b 0.24, 95\% CI 0.11\textendash 0.38). Children exposed prenatally to short-term use of paracetamol (1\textendash 27 days) also had poorer gross motor outcomes (b 0.10, 95\% CI 0.02\textendash 0.19), but the effects were smaller than with long-term use.

  abstract = {Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may increase the risk of childhood diseases by disrupting hormonally mediated processes critical for growth and development during gestation, infancy, or childhood. The fetus, infant, and child may have enhanced sensitivity to environmental stressors like EDCs due to rapid development and greater exposure to some EDCs that results from their developmentally appropriate behavior, anatomy, and physiology. This review summarizes epidemiological studies examining the relations of early-life exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, triclosan, and perfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) with childhood neurobehavioral disorders and obesity. The available epidemiological evidence suggests that prenatal exposure to several of these ubiquitous EDCs is associated with adverse neurobehavior (BPA and phthalates) and excess adiposity or increased risk of obesity/overweight (PFAS). Quantifying the effects of EDC mixtures, improving EDC exposure assessment, reducing bias from confounding, identifying periods of heightened vulnerability, and elucidating the presence and nature of sexually dimorphic EDC effects would result in stronger inferences from epidemiological studies. Ultimately, better estimates of the causal effects of EDC exposures on child health could help identify susceptible sub-populations and lead to public health interventions to reduce these exposures.},

OBJECTIVE: We examined the association between prenatal BPA exposure and behavior in 2-year-old children. METHODS: We used data from 249 mothers and their children in Cincinnati, Ohio (USA). Maternal urine was collected around 16 and 26 weeks of gestation and at birth. BPA concentrations were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography-isotope-dilution tandem mass spectrometry. Child behavior was assessed at 2 years of age using the second edition of the Behavioral Assessment System for Children (BASC-2). The association between prenatal BPA concentrations and BASC-2 scores was analyzed using linear regression. RESULTS: Median BPA concentrations were 1.8 (16 weeks), 1.7 (26 weeks), and 1.3 (birth) ng/mL. Mean (+/- SD) BASC-2 externalizing and internalizing scores were 47.6 +/- 7.8 and 44.8 +/- 7.0, respectively. After adjustment for confounders, log(10)-transformed mean prenatal BPA concentrations were associated with externalizing scores, but only among females [beta = 6.0; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.1-12.0]. Compared with 26-week and birth concentrations, BPA concentrations collected around 16 weeks were more strongly associated with externalizing scores among all children (beta = 2.9; 95\% CI, 0.2-5.7), and this association was stronger in females than in males.

METHODS: We used a prospective birth cohort of 244 mothers and their 3-year-old children from the greater Cincinnati, Ohio, area. We characterized gestational and childhood BPA exposures by using the mean BPA concentrations in maternal (16 and 26 weeks of gestation and birth) and child (1, 2, and 3 years of age) urine samples, respectively. Behavior and executive function were measured by using the Behavior Assessment System for Children 2 (BASC-2) and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool (BRIEF-P). RESULTS: BPA was detected in {$>$}97\% of the gestational (median: 2.0 {$\mu$}g/L) and childhood (median: 4.1 {$\mu$}g/L) urine samples. With adjustment for confounders, each 10-fold increase in gestational BPA concentrations was associated with more anxious and depressed behavior on the BASC-2 and poorer emotional control and inhibition on the BRIEF-P. The magnitude of the gestational BPA associations differed according to child gender; BASC-2 and BRIEF-P scores increased 9 to 12 points among girls, but changes were null or negative among boys. Associations between childhood BPA exposure and neurobehavior were largely null and not modified by child gender. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, gestational BPA exposure affected behavioral and emotional regulation domains at 3 years of age, especially among girls.

  abstract = {Background: Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may be involved in the etiology of autism spectrum disorders, but identifying relevant chemicals within mixtures of EDCs is difficult. Objective: Our goal was to identify gestational EDC exposures associated with autistic behaviors. Methods: We measured the concentrations of 8 phthalate metabolites, bisphenol A, 25 poly\- chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 6 organochlorine pesticides, 8 brominated flame retardants, and 4 perfluoroalkyl substances in blood or urine samples from 175 pregnant women in the HOME (Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment) Study (Cincinnati, OH). When children were 4 and 5 years old, mothers completed the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), a measure of autistic behaviors. We examined confounder-adjusted associations between 52 EDCs and SRS scores using a twostage hierarchical analysis to account for repeated measures and confounding by correlated EDCs. Results: Most of the EDCs were associated with negligible absolute differences in SRS scores ({$\leq$} 1.5). Each 2-SD increase in serum concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ether-28 (PBDE-28) ({$\beta$} = 2.5; 95\% CI: \textendash 0.6, 5.6) or trans-nonachlor ({$\beta$} = 4.1; 95\% CI: 0.8\textendash 7.3) was associated with more autistic behaviors. In contrast, fewer autistic behaviors were observed among children born to women with detectable versus nondetectable concentrations of PCB-178 ({$\beta$} = \textendash 3.0; 95\% CI: \textendash 6.3, 0.2), {$\beta$}-hexachlorocyclohexane ({$\beta$} = \textendash 3.3; 95\% CI: \textendash 6.1, \textendash 0.5), or PBDE-85 ({$\beta$} = \textendash 3.2; 95\% CI: \textendash 5.9, \textendash 0.5). Increasing perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) concentrations were also associated with fewer autistic behaviors ({$\beta$} = \textendash 2.0; 95\% CI: \textendash 4.4, 0.4). Conclusions: Some EDCs were associated with autistic behaviors in this cohort, but our modest sample size precludes us from dismissing chemicals with null associations. PFOA, {$\beta$}-hexachlorocyclohexane, PCB-178, PBDE-28, PBDE-85, and trans-nonachlor deserve additional scrutiny as factors that may be associated with childhood autistic behaviors.},

There is intense interest in determining the impact of exposure to environmental chemical mixtures on human health. As the study of mixtures continues to evolve in the field of environmental epidemiology, it is imperative that we understand the methodologic challenges of this research and the types of questions we can address using epidemiological data. In this article, we summarize some of the unique challenges in exposure assessment, statistical methods, and methodology that epidemiologists face in addressing chemical mixtures. We propose three broad questions that epidemiological studies can address: a) What are the potential health impacts of individual chemical agents? b) What is the interaction among agents? And c) what are the health effects of cumulative exposure to multiple agents? As the field of mixtures research grows, we can use these three questions as a basis for defining our research questions and for developing methods that will help us better understand the effect of chemical exposures on human disease and well-being.},

  abstract = {Background: Prenatal bisphenol A (BPA) exposure has been associated with adverse neurodevelopment in epidemiological studies. However, prior studies had limited statistical power to examine sex-specific effects, and few examined child cognition. Objectives: We estimated the association between prenatal BPA exposure and child neurobehavior at 3 y of age in a prospective cohort of 812 mothers and their children. Methods: We measured BPA concentration in urine samples collected at {$\sim$}12 wk gestation among women enrolled in a 10-city Canadian cohort study. At approximately 3 y of age, we assessed children's cognitive abilities with the Wechsler Primary and Preschool Scale of Intelligence\texttrademark\textendash III (WPPSI-III) and two scales of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function\textendash Preschool (BRIEF-P). Parents reported children's behavior using the Behavior Assessment System for Children\textendash 2 (BASC-2) and the Social Responsiveness Scale\texttrademark{} \textendash{} 2. (SRS-2). We estimated covariate-adjusted differences in neurobehavioral outcomes with a doubling in BPA concentration and sex-specific associations. Results: BPA was not associated with WPPSI-III scores; child sex did not modify these associations. The association between BPA and BRIEF-P scores was modified by child sex (BPA\texttimes sex\hspace{0.6em}p-values{$\leq$}0.03). For example, a doubling of BPA concentration was associated with 1-point (95\% CI: 0.3, 1.7) poorer working memory in boys and 0.5-point (95\% CI: -1.1, 0.1) better scores in girls. BPA was not associated with most BASC-2 scales; however, it was associated with more internalizing and somatizing behaviors in boys, but not in girls (BPA\texttimes sex p-values{$\leq$}0.08). A doubling of BPA concentration was associated with poorer SRS-2 scores [{$\beta$}=0.3 ( 95\% CI: 0, 0.7)]; this association was not modified by sex. Conclusion: Prenatal urinary BPA concentration was associated with some aspects of child behavior in this cohort, and some associations were stronger among boys. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP984},

  abstract = {Background Prenatal chemical exposures may adversely affect neurodevelopment, but few studies have examined the persistence of these associations. We examined whether associations between prenatal bisphenol A (BPA) or polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) exposures persist or resolve as children age. Methods We followed 346 mother-child pairs (enrolled 2003\textendash 2006) from Cincinnati, OH from pregnancy until children were 8 years old. We measured BPA in urine collected at 16 and 26 weeks gestation and PBDE-47 in serum collected at 16 weeks gestation. We administered repeated measures of children's behavior, mental/psychomotor development, and IQ from ages 1\textendash 8 years. We determined if associations of BPA or PBDE-47 with child neurobehavior persisted or resolved as children aged using linear mixed models and estimated neurobehavioral measure reproducibility using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Results Higher BPA in girls and higher PBDE-47 in both boys and girls were associated with more externalizing behaviors; these associations persisted from ages 2\textendash 8 years (exposure \texttimes{} age interaction p-values{$\geq$}0.36). Higher PBDE-47 concentrations were associated with decreases in MDI from ages 1\textendash 3 years (PBDE-47 \texttimes{} age interaction p-value=0.03) and persistently lower IQ at ages 5 and 8 years (PBDE-47 \texttimes{} age interaction p-value=0.56). Mental/psychomotor abilities had fair reproducibility from ages 1\textendash 3 years (ICCs\textasciitilde 0.4), cognitive abilities from ages 5 to 8 years had excellent reproducibility (ICCs=0.7\textendash 0.8), and parent-reported behaviors from ages 2\textendash 8 years had poor to good reproducibility (ICCs=0.38\textendash 0.59). Conclusions Prenatal BPA and PBDE-47 concentrations were persistently associated with more externalizing behaviors.

  abstract = {Context: GNAS is one of few genetic loci that undergo allelic-specific methylation resulting in the parent-specific expression of at least four different transcripts. Due to monoallelic expression, heterozygous GNAS mutations affecting either paternally or maternally derived transcripts cause different forms of pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP), including autosomal-dominant PHP type Ib (AD-PHP1B) associated with loss of methylation (LOM) at exon A/B alone or sporadic PHP1B (sporPHP1B) associated with broad GNAS methylation changes. Similar to effects other imprinted genes have on early development, we recently observed severe intrauterine growth retardation in newborns, later diagnosed with pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism (PPHP) because of paternal GNAS loss-of-function mutations. Objectives: This study aimed to determine whether GNAS methylation abnormalities affect intrauterine growth. Patients and Methods: Birth parameters were collected of patients who later developed sporPHP1B or AD-PHP1B, and of their healthy siblings. Comparisons were made to newborns affected by PPHP or PHP1A. Results: As newborns, AD-PHP1B patients were bigger than their healthy siblings and well above the reference average; increased sizes were particularly evident if the mothers were unaffected carriers of STX16 deletions. SporPHP1B newborns were slightly above average for weight and length, but their overgrowth was less pronounced than that of AD-PHP1B newborns from unaffected mothers. Conclusion: LOM at GNAS exon A/B due to maternal STX16 deletions and the resulting biallelic A/B expression are associated with enhanced fetal growth. These findings are distinctly different from those of PPHP patients with paternal GNAS exons 2\textendash 13 mutations, whose birth parameters are almost 4.5 z-scores below those of AD-PHP1B patients born to healthy mothers.},

  abstract = {Background Paracetamol is the first choice for antipyretic or analgesic treatment throughout pregnancy. Products with Paracetamol are readily available over the counter and therefore easily accessible for self-medication. Epidemiological data on Paracetamol intake pattern during pregnancy and its potential immunological effects are sparse. We aimed to analyze a possible association between Paracetamol medication and numbers of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in cord blood. Methods The objective was addressed in the PRINCE (PRENATAL DETERMINANTS OF CHILDREN'S HEALTH) study, a population-based prospective pregnancy cohort study initiated in 2011 at the University Medical Center in Hamburg, Germany. 518 healthy pregnant women with singleton pregnancies were recruited during the first trimester. Three examinations were scheduled at the end of the 1st (gestational week 12\textendash 14), the 2nd (gestational week 22\textendash 24) and the 3rd trimester (gestational week 34\textendash 36). For 146 of these women, cord blood flow cytometry data were available. Paracetamol intake was assessed for each trimester of pregnancy. Findings Among the 518 enrolled women, 40\% took Paracetamol as main analgesic treatment during pregnancy. The intake frequency and dosage of Paracetamol varied between the women and was overall low with a tendency towards higher frequencies and higher dosages in the third trimester. Paracetamol intake, particularly during the third trimester, resulted in decreased relative numbers of HSCs in cord blood, independent of maternal age, first-trimester BMI, parity, gestational age and birth weight (-0.286 (95\% CI -0.592, 0.021), p=0.068). Interpretation Prenatal Paracetamol intake, especially during the third trimester, may be causally involved in decreasing HSCs in cord blood.},

  abstract = {Tenascin-X is an extracellular matrix protein initially identified because the gene encoding it overlaps with the human CYP21B gene. Because studies of gene and protein function of other tenascins had been poorly predictive of essential functions in vivo, we used a genetic approach that critically relied on an understanding of the genomic locus to uncover an association between inactivating tenascin-X mutations and novel recessive and dominant forms of Ehlers\textendash Danlos syndrome (EDS). Tenascin-X provides the first example of a gene outside of the fibrillar collagens and their processing enzymes that causes EDS. Tenascin-X null mice recapitulate the skin findings of the human disease, confirming a causative role for this gene in EDS. Further evaluation of these mice showed that tenascin-X is an important regulator of collagen deposition in vivo, suggesting a novel mechanism of disease in this form of EDS. Further studies suggest that tenascin-X may do this through both direct and indirect interactions with the collagen fibril. Recent studies show that TNX effects on matrix extend beyond the collagen to the elastogenic pathway and matrix remodeling enzymes. Tenascin-X serves as a compelling example of how human ``experiments of nature'' can guide us to an understanding of genes whose function may not be evident from their sequence or in vitro studies of their encoded proteins. \textcopyright{} 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Evolving evidence links maternal stress exposure to changes in placental DNA methylation of specific genes regulating placental function that may have implications for the programming of a host of chronic disorders. Few studies have implemented an epigenome-wide approach. Using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450K), we investigated epigenome-wide placental DNA methylation in relation to maternal experiences of traumatic and non-traumatic stressors over her lifetime assessed using the Life Stressor Checklist-Revised (LSC-R) survey (n = 207). We found differential DNA methylation at epigenome-wide statistical significance (FDR = 0.05) for 112 CpGs. Additionally, we observed three clusters that exhibited differential methylation in response to high maternal lifetime stress. Enrichment analyses, conducted at an FDR = 0.20, revealed lysine degradation to be the most significant pathway associated with maternal lifetimes stress exposure. Targeted enrichment analyses of the three largest clusters of probes, identified using the gap statistic, were enriched for genes associated with endocytosis (i.e., SMAP1, ANKFY1), tight junctions (i.e., EPB41L4B), and metabolic pathways (i.e., INPP5E, EEF1B2). These pathways, also identified in the top 10 KEGG pathways associated with maternal lifetime stress exposure, play important roles in multiple physiological functions necessary for proper fetal development. Further, two genes were identified to exhibit multiple probes associated with maternal lifetime stress (i.e., ANKFY1, TM6SF1).

  abstract = {During human pregnancy, the production of 17-beta-estradiol (E2) rises steadily to eighty fold at term, and placenta has been found to specifically bind estrogens. We have recently demonstrated the expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha) protein in human placenta and its localization in villous cytotrophoblast (CT), vascular pericytes, and amniotic fibroblasts. In vitro, E2 stimulated development of large syncytiotrophoblast (ST) aggregates. In the present study we utilized ER-beta affinity purified polyclonal (N19:sc6820) and ER-alpha monoclonal (clone h-151) antibodies. Western blot analysis revealed a single \textasciitilde 52 kDa ER-beta band in chorionic villi (CV) protein extracts. In CV, strong cytoplasmic ER-beta immunoreactivity was confined to ST. Dual color immunohistochemistry revealed asymmetric segregation of ER-alpha in dividing villous CT cells. Prior to separation, the cell nuclei more distant from ST exhibited high ER-alpha, while cell nuclei associated with ST showed diminution of ER-alpha and appearance of ER-beta. In trophoblast cultures, development of ST aggregates was associated with diminution of ER-alpha and appearance of ER-beta immunoreactivity. ER-beta was also detected in endothelial cells, amniotic epithelial cells and fibroblasts, extravillous trophoblast (nuclear and cytoplasmic) and decidual cells (cytoplasmic only). In addition, CFK-E12 (E12) and CWK-F12 (F12) monoclonal antibodies, which recognize \textasciitilde 64 kDa ER-beta with hormone binding domain, showed nuclear-specific reactivity with villous ST, extravillous trophoblast, and amniotic epithelium and fibroblasts. Western blot analysis indicated abundant expression of a \textasciitilde 64 kDa ER-beta variant in trophoblast cultures, significantly higher when compared to the chorionic villi and freshly isolated trophoblast cell protein extracts. This is the first report on ER-beta expression in human placenta and cultured trophoblast. Our data indicate that during trophoblast differentiation, the ER-alpha is associated with a less, and ER-beta with the more differentiated state. Enhanced expression of \textasciitilde 64 kDa ER-beta variant in trophoblast cultures suggests a unique role of ER-beta hormone binding domain in the regulation of trophoblast differentiation. Our data also indicate that asymmetric segregation of ER-alpha may play a role in asymmetric division of estrogen-dependent cells.},

  abstract = {Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor driven by cells with hallmarks of neural stem (NS) cells. GBM stem cells frequently express high levels of the transcription factors FOXG1 and SOX2. Here we show that increased expression of these factors restricts astrocyte differentiation and can trigger dedifferentiation to a proliferative NS cell state. Transcriptional targets include cell cycle and epigenetic regulators (e.g., Foxo3, Plk1, Mycn, Dnmt1, Dnmt3b, and Tet3). Foxo3 is a critical repressed downstream effector that is controlled via a conserved FOXG1/SOX2-bound cis-regulatory element. Foxo3 loss, combined with exposure to the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine, enforces astrocyte dedifferentiation. DNA methylation profiling in differentiating astrocytes identifies changes at multiple polycomb targets, including the promoter of Foxo3 In patient-derived GBM stem cells, CRISPR/Cas9 deletion of FOXG1 does not impact proliferation in vitro; however, upon transplantation in vivo, FOXG1-null cells display increased astrocyte differentiation and up-regulate FOXO3. In contrast, SOX2 ablation attenuates proliferation, and mutant cells cannot be expanded in vitro. Thus, FOXG1 and SOX2 operate in complementary but distinct roles to fuel unconstrained self-renewal in GBM stem cells via transcriptional control of core cell cycle and epigenetic regulators.},

  abstract = {Organophosphorus (OP) insecticides are pest-control agents heavily used worldwide. Unfortunately, they are also well known for the toxic effects that they can trigger in humans. Clinical manifestations of an acute exposure of humans to OP insecticides include a well-defined cholinergic crisis that develops as a result of the irreversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the enzyme that hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). Prolonged exposures to levels of OP insecticides that are insufficient to trigger signs of acute intoxication, which are hereafter referred to as subacute exposures, have also been associated with neurological deficits. In particular, epidemiological studies have reported statistically significant correlations between prenatal subacute exposures to OP insecticides, including chlorpyrifos, and neurological deficits that range from cognitive impairments to tremors in childhood. The primary objectives of this article are: (i) to address the short- and long-term neurological issues that have been associated with acute and subacute exposures of humans to OP insecticides, especially early in life (ii) to discuss the translational relevance of animal models of developmental exposure to OP insecticides, and (iii) to review mechanisms that are likely to contribute to the developmental neurotoxicity of OP insecticides. Most of the discussion will be focused on chlorpyrifos, the top-selling OP insecticide in the United States and throughout the world. These points are critical for the identification and development of safe and effective interventions to counter and/or prevent the neurotoxic effects of these chemicals in the developing brain.},

  abstract = {Background Heart failure (HF) is associated with inflammation characterized by the formation of the inflammasome, which triggers maturation of inflammatory cytokines. Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein with a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), a vital component of the inflammasome, is controlled through epigenetic modification, which may be a candidate pathway for worsening HF. This study examined the inflammasome pathway in HF and the relationships between ASC CpG methylation and outcomes in HF. Methods and Results Stored samples from 155 HF outpatients (ejection fraction 29.9\,{$\pm$}\,14.9\%) were analyzed for percentage methylation of 7 CpG sites in the intron region preceding exon 1 of the ASC gene. ASC methylation was inversely related to ASC mRNA (r\,=\,-0.33; P\,{$<$}\,.001) and protein (r\,=\,-0.464; P\,{$<$}\,.001). ASC methylation had a positive linear relationship with ejection fraction (r\,=\,0.85; P\,{$<$}\,.001), quality of life (r\,=\,0.83; P\,{$<$}\,.001), and 6-minute walk test (r\,=\,0.59; P\,=\,.023) and a negative linear relationship with depression (r\,=\,-0.81; P\,{$<$}\,.001) and anxiety (r\,=\,-0.75; P\,{$<$}\,.001). Higher ASC methylation was associated with a lower risk for clinical events (hazard ratio [HR] 0.16; P\,=\,.025), whereas higher protein (HR\,=\,1.78; P\,=\,.045) and mRNA expression (HR\,=\,1.18; P\,=\,.05) were associated with a greater risk. Conclusions Increased methylation of CpG sites in the intron region of ASC is associated with improved outcomes in HF. The associated decrease in ASC expression implicates this inflammatory mediator as a possible driver of HF outcomes and may represent a therapeutic target.},

Methods: Cross-sectional analysis in preadolescents aged 9\textendash 12 years from the Generation R Study, a populationbased birth cohort set up in Rotterdam, The Netherlands (n = 2592). An integrated exposure model was used to estimate whole-brain and lobe-specific RF-EMF doses (mJ/kg/day) from different RF-EMF sources including mobile and Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) phone calls, other mobile phone uses than calling, tablet use, laptop use, and far-field sources. Whole-brain and lobe-specific RF-EMF doses were estimated for all RF-EMF sources together (i.e. overall) and for three groups of RF-EMF sources that lead to a different pattern of RF-EMF exposure. Information on brain volumes was extracted from magnetic resonance imaging scans. Results: Estimated overall whole-brain RF-EMF dose was 84.3 mJ/kg/day. The highest overall lobe-specific dose was estimated in the temporal lobe (307.1 mJ/kg/day). Whole-brain and lobe-specific RF-EMF doses from all RFEMF sources together, from mobile and DECT phone calls, and from far-field sources were not associated with global, cortical, or subcortical brain volumes. However, a higher whole-brain RF-EMF dose from mobile phone use for internet browsing, e-mailing, and text messaging, tablet use, and laptop use while wirelessly connected to the internet was associated with a smaller caudate volume.

Epigenetic alterations are present in different tissues along the aging process and in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Epigenetics affect life span and longevity. AD-related genes exhibit epigenetic changes, indicating that epigenetics might exert a pathogenic role in dementia. Epigenetic modifications are reversible and can potentially be targeted by pharmacological intervention. Epigenetic drugs may be useful for the treatment of major problems of health (e.g., cancer, cardiovascular disorders, brain disorders). The efficacy and safety of these and other medications depend upon the efficiency of the pharmacogenetic process in which different clusters of genes (pathogenic, mechanistic, metabolic, transporter, pleiotropic) are involved. Most of these genes are also under the influence of the epigenetic machinery. The information available on the pharmacoepigenomics of most drugs is very limited; however, growing evidence indicates that epigenetic changes are determinant in the pathogenesis of many medical conditions and in drug response and drug resistance. Consequently, pharmacoepigenetic studies should be incorporated in drug development and personalized treatments.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The exposome is defined as encompassing all environmental exposures one undergoes from conception onwards. Challenges of the application of this concept to environmental-health association studies include a possibly high false-positive rate. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to reduce the dimension of the exposome using information from DNA methylation as a way to more efficiently characterize the relation between exposome and child body mass index (BMI). METHODS: Among 1,173 mother-child pairs from HELIX cohort, 216 exposures ("whole exposome") were characterized. BMI and DNA methylation from immune cells of peripheral blood were assessed in children at age 6-10~years. A priori reduction of the methylome to preselect BMI-relevant CpGs was performed using biological pathways. We then implemented a tailored Meet-in-the-Middle approach to identify from these CpGs candidate mediators in the exposome-BMI association, using univariate linear regression models corrected for multiple testing: this allowed to point out exposures most likely to be associated with BMI ("reduced exposome"). Associations of this reduced exposome with BMI were finally tested. The approach was compared to an agnostic exposome-wide association study (ExWAS) ignoring the methylome. RESULTS: Among the 2284 preselected CpGs (0.6\% of the assessed CpGs), 62 were associated with BMI. Four factors (3 postnatal and 1 prenatal) of the exposome were associated with at least one of these CpGs, among which postnatal blood level of copper and PFOS were directly associated with BMI, with respectively positive and negative estimated effects. The agnostic ExWAS identified 18 additional postnatal exposures, including many persistent pollutants, generally unexpectedly associated with decreased BMI. DISCUSSION: Our approach incorporating a priori information identified fewer significant associations than an agnostic approach. We hypothesize that this smaller number corresponds to a higher specificity (and possibly lower sensitivity), compared to the agnostic approach. Indeed, the latter cannot distinguish causal relations from reverse causation, e.g. for persistent compounds stored in fat, whose circulating level is influenced by BMI.},

  abstract = {Bisphenol A (BPA) is a high production volume industrial chemical used widely in the production of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins for manufacturing food and drink storage containers, the lining of food cans, dental sealants, medical devices, and thermal paper. Biomonitoring studies show that there is widespread exposure of the human population to BPA, mainly via the diet. The median daily intake of the overall US population is approximately 25 ng BPA/kg body weight (bw)/day, which is estimated to result in serum levels of BPA in the pM range. BPA is an endocrine-disrupting chemical, with known estrogenic activity; more recently, it has been reported to induce epigenetic changes in vitro and in vivo, including effects in DNA methylation, differential histone modifications, and modulation of the levels of noncoding RNAs. This chapter summarizes the studies reporting epigenetic effects associated with human exposure to BPA or induced by the in vitro or in vivo exposure to the chemical. The literature suggesting an association between human exposure to BPA and epigenetic changes is limited. Several studies have assessed the effects of BPA in in vitro cell systems and suggest treatment-related epigenetic effects; the lowest effective BPA dose in vitro was in the nM dose range and the dose-response in these studies tended to be linear. In vivo animal studies suggest epigenetic effects of BPA in a wide range of organs, dose levels, and epigenetic endpoints; however, many studies have limitations, including the use of a single dose level that precludes the characterization of the dose-response of the reported effects.

Epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation may modulate POMC expression and provide a biological link between early life exposures and later phenotype. Animal studies suggest epigenetic marks at POMC are influenced by maternal energy excess and restriction, prenatal stress and Triclosan exposure. Postnatal factors including energy excess, folate, vitamin A, conjugated linoleic acid and leptin may also affect POMC methylation. Recent human studies suggest POMC DNA methylation is influenced by maternal nutrition in early pregnancy and associated with childhood and adult obesity. Studies in children propose a link between POMC DNA methylation and elevated lipids and insulin, independent of body habitus. This review brings together evidence from animal and human studies and suggests that POMC is sensitive to nutritional programming and is associated with a wide range of weight-related and metabolic outcomes.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a fetal growth complication that can be caused by ineffective nutrient transfer from the mother to the fetus via the placenta. Abnormal placental development and function have been correlated with abnormal expression of imprinted genes, which are regulated by epigenetic modifications at imprinting control regions (ICRs). In this study, we analyzed the expression of imprinted genes known to be involved in fetal growth and epigenetic regulators involved in DNA methylation, as well as DNA methylation at the KvDMR1 imprinting control region and global levels of DNA hydroxymethylation, in IUGR cases. METHODS: Expression levels of imprinted genes and epigenetic regulators were analyzed in term placental samples from 21 IUGR cases and 9 non-IUGR (control) samples, by RT-qPCR. Additionally, KvDMR1 methylation was analyzed by bisulfite sequencing and combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) techniques. Moreover, global DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation levels were also measured. RESULTS: We observed increased expression of PHLDA2, CDKN1C, and PEG10 imprinted genes and of DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, and TET3 epigenetic regulators in IUGR placentas. No differences in methylation levels at the KvDMR1 were observed between the IUGR and control groups; similarly, no differences in global DNA methylation and hydromethylation were detected. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that deregulation of epigenetic mechanisms, namely increased expression of imprinted genes and epigenetic regulators, might be associated with IUGR etiology. Therefore, this study adds knowledge to the molecular mechanisms underlying IUGR, which may contribute to novel prediction tools and future therapeutic options for the management of IUGR pregnancies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia represents a major cause of maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide. Although it is known that the placenta plays a central role in development of preeclampsia, investigation into the contribution of environmental toxicants to the risk of preeclampsia has been sparse. OBJECTIVES: In the present study we examined the relationship between longitudinally measured urinary BPA and phthalate metabolite concentrations during gestation and preeclampsia. METHODS: A nested case-control study of preterm birth was performed in 2011 from women enrolled in a prospective birth cohort study at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. There were 50 cases of preeclampsia as part of this study. Urine samples were analyzed for concentrations of BPA and nine phthalate metabolites several times during pregnancy. Adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate hazard ratios of preeclampsia in association with an interquartile range increase in BPA and phthalate concentrations and were weighted to reflect results generalizable to the base population. RESULTS: Adjusted hazard ratios indicated that an interquartile range increase of urinary concentrations of BPA (1.53; 95\% CI: 1.04, 2.25) and MEP (monoethyl phthalate) (1.72; 95\% CI: 1.28, 2.30) at 10 weeks gestation was associated with onset of preeclampsia, whereas significantly elevated hazard ratios were found across gestation for all DEHP [di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate] metabolites. These relationships differed based on infant sex. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary concentrations of BPA and several phthalate metabolites were significantly associated with increased risk of preeclampsia. If validated, these results indicate an environmental contribution of endocrine-disrupting chemicals to preeclampsia and suggest a modifiable means to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with this condition.

Here, we showed that when pregnant mice were treated with 8\,mg/kg TCS (8-TCS mice) on gestational days (GD) 6\textendash 18 fetal body weights were lower than controls. Placental weights and volumes were reduced in 8-TCS mice. The placental proliferative cells and expression of PCNA and Cyclin D3 on GD13 were remarkably decreased in 8-TCS mice. The decreases in activities and expression of placental System A amino acid or glucose transporters on GD14 and GD17 were observed in 8-TCS mice. Levels of serum thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) were lower in 8-TCS mice than those in controls. Declines of placental Akt, mTOR and P70S6K phosphorylation in 8-TCS mice were corrected by L-thyroxinein (T4). Treating 8-TCS mice with T4 rescued the placental cell proliferation and recovered the activity and expression of amino acid and glucose transporters, which were sensitive to mTOR inhibition by rapamycin. Furthermore, the replacement of T4 could rescue the decrease in fetal body weight, which was blocked by rapamycin. These findings indicate that TCS-induced hypothyroxinemia in gestation mice through reducing Akt-mTOR signaling may impair placental development and nutrient transfer leading to decreases in fetal body weight.},

Mean birth weight was 3,443 (standard deviation, 423) g, and 38 mothers (8.6\%) reported smoking at a mean of 9.4 weeks of gestation. Prenatal maternal smoking was associated with a 175-g lower birth weight (95\% confidence interval (CI): -305.5, -44.8) and with differential DNAm of 71 CpGs in placenta, robust to latent-factor adjustment reflecting cell types (Bonferroni-adjusted P {$<$} 6.94 \texttimes{} 10-8).

Gene/environment interactions in autism were analysed using 206 autism susceptibility genes (ASG's) from the Autworks database to interrogate \textasciitilde 1 million chemical/gene interactions in the comparative toxicogenomics database. Any bias towards ASG's was statistically determined for each chemical. Many suspect compounds identified in epidemiology, including tetrachlorodibenzodioxin, pesticides, particulate matter, benzo(a)pyrene, heavy metals, valproate, acetaminophen, SSRI's, cocaine, bisphenol A, phthalates, polyhalogenated biphenyls, flame retardants, diesel constituents, terbutaline and oxytocin, inter alia showed a significant degree of bias towards ASG's, as did relevant endogenous agents (retinoids, sex steroids, thyroxine, melatonin, folate, dopamine, serotonin). Numerous other suspected endocrine disruptors (over 100) selectively targeted ASG's including paraquat, atrazine and other pesticides not yet studied in autism and many compounds used in food, cosmetics or household products, including tretinoin, soy phytoestrogens, aspartame, titanium dioxide and sodium fluoride. Autism polymorphisms influence the sensitivity to some of these chemicals and these same genes play an important role in barrier function and control of respiratory cilia sweeping particulate matter from the airways. Pesticides, heavy metals and pollutants also disrupt barrier and/or ciliary function, which is regulated by sex steroids and by bitter/sweet taste receptors. Further epidemiological studies and neurodevelopmental and behavioural research is warranted to determine the relevance of large number of suspect candidates whose addition to the environment, household, food and cosmetics might be fuelling the autism epidemic in a gene-dependent manner.},

Methods: BPA was measured in spot urine samples collected in trimester 1 and 3 of pregnancy from women participating in the INMA-Sabadell birth cohort study. Cognitive and psychomotor development was assessed at 1 and 4 years using psychologist-based scales. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms and other behavioral problems were assessed at 4 years by teachers and at 7 years by parents using questionnaire-based rating scales. Results: Geometric mean creatinine-adjusted BPA concentration of the averaged samples was 2.6 {$\mu$}g/g creatinine. BPA exposure was not associated with the cognitive scores or their subscales at 1 and 4 years of age. At 1 year of age, exposure in the highest tertile of BPA concentrations was associated with a reduction of psychomotor scores (T3 vs T1 {$\beta\frac{1}{4}$} \`A 4.28 points, 95\% CI: \`A 8.15, \`A 0.41), but there was no association with psychomotor outcomes at 4 years. At 4 years, BPA exposure was associated with an increased risk of ADHDhyperactivity symptoms (Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) per log10 {$\mu$}g BPA/g creatinine increase{$\frac{1}{4}$}1.72; 1.08, 2.73) and this association was stronger in boys than in girls. Further, boys had an increased risk of ADHD-inattention symptoms whereas girls showed a reduced risk (p for interaction o0.1). At 7 years, these associations were not statistically significant nor were any other behavioral problems. Conclusions: These results suggest that prenatal BPA exposure does not affect cognitive development up to age 4 years. Associations are observed with psychomotor development and ADHD-related symptoms at early ages, but these do not appear to persist until later ages.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates may affect fetal growth; however, previous findings are inconsistent and based on few studies. OBJECTIVES: We assessed whether prenatal exposure to BPA and phthalates was associated with fetal growth in a Spanish birth cohort of 488 mother-child pairs. METHODS: We measured BPA and eight phthalates [four di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolites (DEHPm), mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP), and three low-molecular-weight phthalate metabolites (LMWPm)] in two spot-urine samples collected during the first and third trimester of pregnancy. We estimated growth curves for femur length (FL), head circumference (HC), abdominal circumference (AC), biparietal diameter (BPD), and estimated fetal weight (EFW) during pregnancy (weeks 12-20 and 20-34), and for birth weight, birth length, head circumference at birth, and placental weight. RESULTS: Overall, results did not support associations of exposure to BPA or DEHPm during pregnancy with fetal growth parameters. Prenatal MBzP exposure was positively associated with FL at 20-34 weeks, resulting in an increase of 3.70\% of the average FL (95\% CI: 0.75, 6.63\%) per doubling of MBzP concentration. MBzP was positively associated with birth weight among boys (48 g; 95\% CI: 6, 90) but not in girls (-27 g; 95\% CI: -79, 25) (interaction p-value = 0.04). The LMWPm mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) was negatively associated with HC at 12-20 pregnancy weeks [-4.88\% of HC average (95\% CI: -8.36, -1.36\%)]. CONCLUSIONS: This study, one of the first to combine repeat exposure biomarker measurements and multiple growth measures during pregnancy, finds little evidence of associations of BPA or phthalate exposures with fetal growth. Phthalate metabolites MBzP and MnBP were associated with some fetal growth parameters, but these findings require replication.

Objectives We evaluated the variability of urinary concentrations of 24 non-persistent chemicals: 10 phthalate metabolites, 7 phenols, 6 organophosphate (OP) pesticide metabolites, and cotinine, between weeks from different pregnancy trimesters in pregnant women, and between days and between seasons in children. Methods 154 pregnant women and 152 children from six European countries were enrolled in 2014\textendash 2015. Pregnant women provided three urine samples over a day (morning, midday, and night), for one week in the 2nd and 3rd pregnancy trimesters. Children provided two urines a day (morning and night), over two one-week periods, six months apart. We pooled all samples for a given subject that were collected within a week. In children, we also made four daily pools (combining morning and night voids) during the last four days of the first follow-up week. Pools were analyzed for all 24 metabolites of interest. We calculated intraclass-correlation coefficients (ICC) and estimated the number of pools needed to obtain an ICC above 0.80. Results All phthalate metabolites and phenols were detected in {$>$}90\% of pools whereas certain OP pesticide metabolites and cotinine were detected in {$<$}43\% of pools. We observed fair (ICC = 0.40\textendash 0.59) to good (0.60\textendash 0.74) between-day reliability of the pools of two samples in children for all chemicals. Reliability was poor ({$<$}0.40) to fair between trimesters in pregnant women and between seasons in children. For most chemicals, three daily pools of two urines each (for weekly exposure windows) and four weekly pools of 15\textendash 20 urines each would be necessary to obtain an ICC above 0.80. Conclusions This quantification of the variability of biomarker measurements of many non-persistent chemicals during several time windows shows that for many of these compounds a few dozen samples are required to accurately assess exposure over periods encompassing several trimesters or months.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) during prenatal and postnatal life has been extensively studied in relation to adverse health effects in children. OBJECTIVES: The aim was to identify determinants of the concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), brominated flame retardants (polybrominated diphenyl ethers, PBDEs; polybrominated biphenyl, PBB), and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in blood samples from pregnant women and children in The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). METHODS: Blood samples were collected from two independent subsamples within MoBa; a group of women (n=96) enrolled in mid-pregnancy during the years 2002-2008 and a group of 3 year old children (n=99) participating during 2010-2011. PCB congeners (74, 99, 138, 153, 180, 170, 194, 209, 105, 114, 118, 156, 157, 167, and 189), brominated flame retardants (PBDE-28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154, and PBB-153), as well as the OCPs hexachlorobenzene (HCB), oxychlordane, 4,4'dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), and 4,4'dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) were measured in both pregnant women and children. RESULTS: Age, low parity, and low pre-pregnant BMI were the most important determinants of increased plasma concentrations of POPs in pregnant women. In 3 year old children, prolonged breastfeeding duration was a major determinant of increased POP concentrations. Estimated dietary exposure to PCBs during pregnancy was positively associated with plasma concentrations in 3 year old children, but not in pregnant women. Plasma concentrations were approximately 40\% higher in children compared to pregnant women. CONCLUSIONS: Several factors associated with exposure and toxicokinetics, i.e. accumulation, excretion and transfer via breastmilk of POPs were the main predictors of POP levels in pregnant women and children. Diet, which is the main exposure source for these compounds in the general population, was found to predict PCB levels only among children. For the PBDEs, for which non-dietary sources are more important, toxicokinetic factors appeared to have less predictive impact.},

Two hundred twenty seven studies were searched from databases. Among those, 41 systematic reviews (SRs) were included: 9 focused on prenatal factors, 5 on perinatal factors, and 27 on postnatal factors. Of these 41 SRs, 83\% had good methodological quality, as determined by the AMSTAR tool. After reviewing all evidence, parental asthma, prenatal environmental tobacco smoke and prematurity (particularly very preterm birth) are well-established risk factors for childhood asthma. Current findings do suggest mild to moderate causal effects of certain modifiable behaviors or exposures during pregnancy (maternal weight gain or obesity, maternal use of antibiotics or paracetamol, and maternal stress), the perinatal period (birth by Caesarean delivery), or postnatal life (severe RSV infection, overweight or obesity, indoor exposure to mold or fungi, and outdoor air pollution) on childhood asthma, but this suggestive evidence must be confirmed in interventional studies or (if interventions are not feasible) well-designed prospective studies.},

  abstract = {Organophosphate based pesticides are widely used in the agricultural sector, and exposure to these chemicals is common for the general population. Pesticides are toxic due to the inhibition of acetylcholinesterases, and the potential for adverse health effects have been investigated in past and recent studies. Human biomonitoring of organophosphate pesticide exposure is carried out through the determination of the metabolites in urine (dialkylphosphates, DAPs). Hereby we present a new method for determination of the 6 non-specific metabolites dimethyl phosphate (DMP), diethyl phosphate (DEP), dimethyl thiophosphate (DMTP), diethyl thiophosphate (DETP), dimethyl dithiophosphate (DMDTP), and diethyl dithiophosphate (DEDTP) in urine based on off-line solid phase extraction (anion exchange, 96-well plates) followed by ion-pair ultra-performance liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Recoveries and accuracies in control urine spiked at 5ng/mL ranged from 48\% to109\% and from 91\% to 115\%, respectively. The method limits of detection for the DAPs were 1.2ng/mL for DMP, 0.38ng/mL for DEP, 0.20ng/mL for DMTP, 0.33ng/mL for DETP, 0.64ng/mL for DMDTP, and 0.15ng/mL for DEDTP. The method was applied to samples from a Norwegian mother/child study group (n=48/56) and the DAPs detection frequencies in urine from mothers and children were about: 40\% for DMP, 95\% for DEP, 96\% for DMTP, 50\% for DETP, 15\% for DMDTP, and 1\% for DEDTP. In both mothers and children, the most abundant DAPs were DMTP (median 2.4/5.2ng/mL) and DEP (median 2.6/3.4ng/mL) followed by DMP (median 1.5/2.1ng/mL). The SG corrected concentrations of DEP and DETP in mothers were statistically higher than in children (p-value{$<$}0.05; Mann-Whitney test) which might suggest a higher exposure to pesticides in these mothers, or significant differences in toxicokinetics between adults and children. The method was proven robust and suitable for large-scale biomonitoring studies.},

In the present study, we used human neuroepithelial (NE) cells and CHARGE patient-derived cells as an in vitro model system to identify the function of chromodomain helicase DNA-binding 7 (CHD7) in NE-neural crest bifurcation, thus revealing an etiological link between the central nervous system (CNS) and craniofacial anomalies observed in CHARGE syndrome. We found that CHD7 is required for epigenetic activation of superenhancers and CNS-specific enhancers, which support the maintenance of the NE and CNS lineage identities. Furthermore, we found that BRN2 and SOX21 are downstream effectors of CHD7, which shapes cellular identities by enhancing a CNS-specific cellular program and indirectly repressing non-CNS-specific cellular programs. Based on our results, CHD7, through its interactions with superenhancer elements, acts as a regulatory hub in the orchestration of the spatiotemporal dynamics of transcription factors to regulate NE and CNS lineage identities.},

  abstract = {The commonly mutated genes in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) are ATRX, DAXX, and MEN1. We genotyped 64 PanNETs and found 58\% carry ATRX, DAXX, and MEN1 mutations (A-D-M mutant PanNETs) and this correlates with a worse clinical outcome than tumors carrying the wild-type alleles of all three genes (A-D-M WT PanNETs). We performed RNA sequencing and DNA-methylation analysis to reveal two distinct subgroups with one consisting entirely of A-D-M mutant PanNETs. Two genes differentiating A-D-M mutant from A-D-M WT PanNETs were high ARX and low PDX1 gene expression with PDX1 promoter hyper-methylation in the A-D-M mutant PanNETs. Moreover, A-D-M mutant PanNETs had a gene expression signature related to that of alpha-cells (FDR q-value\,{$<$}\,0.009) of pancreatic islets including increased expression of HNF1A and its transcriptional target genes. This gene expression profile suggests that A-D-M mutant PanNETs originate from or transdifferentiate into a distinct cell type similar to alpha cells.},

  abstract = {The present study assessed the association between phthalate exposure and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymerase {$\gamma$} (POLG) methylation along with the potential effect on the characteristics of body fat in children. A total of 152 children were enrolled. The urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites were measured using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Genomic DNA was extracted from the buffy coat, and bisulfite-treated DNA was subjected to a pyrosequencing assay. In total, 17 CpG sites in the exon 2 region of POLG were included in the analysis. A multivariable regression model was applied to determine whether characteristics of body fat were associated with phthalate exposure and methylation of POLG. After adjustment for covariates, male children with a ten-fold increase in mono-methyl phthalate (MMP) or mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) concentrations had significantly higher measurements for total body fat (MMP: {$\beta~$}=~6.47\%; MBzP: {$\beta~$}=~3.54\%), and trunk fat (MMP: {$\beta~$}=~6.67\%; MBzP: {$\beta~$}=~3.90\%). Male children who had hypermethylation at the 2nd CpG site in exon 2 of POLG also had high measurements for BMI ({$\beta~$}=~1.66~kg/m2), waist ({$\beta~$}=~4.49~cm) and hip ({$\beta~$}=~4.81~cm) circumference, total body fat ({$\beta~$}=~5.48\%), and trunk fat ({$\beta~$}=~6.21\%). A dose-response relationship existed between methylation at the 2nd CpG site in exon 2 of POLG and characteristics of body fat (p for trend{$<$}0.01). This study suggested that male children who are exposed to phthalic acid esters have high body weight, BMI, and body and trunk fat percentages. Methylation of the exon 2 region of POLG is a possible mechanism behind the causal effect of endocrine-disrupting substances.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: While paracetamol exposure in pregnancy and early infancy has been associated with asthma, it remains unclear whether this is confounded by respiratory tract infections, which have been suggested as an alternative explanation. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies that reported the association between paracetamol exposure during pregnancy or infancy and the subsequent development of childhood asthma ({$\geq$}5\hspace{0.25em}years). METHODS: Two independent researchers searched the databases EMBASE and PUBMED on 12 August 2013 for relevant articles using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Study quality was assessed and results were pooled using fixed effect models or random effect models when moderate between-study heterogeneity was observed. We explicitly assessed whether the observed associations are due to confounding by respiratory tract infections. RESULTS: Eleven observational cohort studies met the inclusion criteria. Any paracetamol use during the first trimester was related to increased risk of childhood asthma (5 studies, pooled OR=1.39, 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.91) but there was marked between-study heterogeneity (I(2)=63\%) and only one of these studies adjusted for maternal respiratory tract infections. Increasing frequency of use of paracetamol during infancy was associated with increased odds of childhood asthma (3 studies, pooled OR=1.15, 95\% CI 1.00 to 1.31 per doubling of days exposure), but in these same three studies adjusting for respiratory tract infections reduced this association (OR=1.06, 95\% CI 0.92 to 1.22). DISCUSSION: The association during early pregnancy exposure was highly variable between studies and exposure during infancy appears to be moderately confounded by respiratory tract infections. There is insufficient evidence to warrant changing guidelines on early life paracetamol exposure at this time.},

  abstract = {Multiple imputation (MI) is a commonly used technique for handling missing data in large-scale medical and public health studies. An important and longstanding statistical problem is how to conduct variable selection on the multiply-imputed data. If a variable selection method is applied to each imputed dataset separately, it may select different variables in different imputed datasets and make it difficult to interpret the final model or draw the scientific conclusions. In this paper, we propose two novel variable selection methods for the multiply-imputed data. Both methods jointly fit models on multiple imputed datasets and yield a consistent selection of variables across all imputed datasets. The first method is called MI-stepwise method, which is an extension of the stepwise selection method. It is implemented by first obtaining combined p-values using Rubin's rules for MI inference (Rubin 1987; Little and Rubin 2002) and then selecting variables base on the combined p-values in each step of selection. The second method is called MI-lasso method, which is an extension of the lasso method (Tibshrani, 1996). It treats the estimated regression coefficients of the same variable across all imputed datasets as a group, and applies the group lasso penalty (Yuan and Lin 2006) to yield a consistent variable selection across multiple imputed datasets. The proposed methods are demonstrated using simulation studies. We also apply the two methods to the University of Michigan Dioxin Exposure Study (UMDES) to identify important environmental exposure factors that are associated with serum dioxin concentrations.},

Infection and inflammation are critical processes in placental development and pregnancy-related diseases. In particular, infection is the leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity worldwide. However, to date, no successful approach has been developed for the effective diagnosis of infection in preterm infants. Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a serious disorder that adversely affects \textasciitilde 5\% of human pregnancies. Recent studies identified a multiprotein complex, the inflammasome, including the Nod-like receptor (NLR) family of cytosolic pattern recognition receptors, the adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) and caspase-1, which plays a vital role in the placenta. The thyroid hormone modulates inflammation processes and is additionally implicated in placental development and disease. Therefore, elucidation of thyroid hormone receptor-regulated inflammation-related molecules, and their underlying mechanisms in placenta, should facilitate the identification of novel predictive and therapeutic targets for placental disorders. This review provides a detailed summary of current knowledge with respect to identification of useful biomarkers and their physiological significance in placenta.},

Previous study using a knockout mouse model revealed a crucial role of PEG10 in placental development, yet the exact function of PEG10 during placentation remains to be elucidated. In this study, denuded chorionic villi were prepared from first trimester human placentas, and transduced with PEG10 small interference RNA (siRNA) or non-targeting control sequence by lentiviral infection. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that silencing of PEG10 in the chorionic villous explants resulted in reduced immune-reactivity to CK7, Ki67 and integrin {$\alpha$}5, implying that silencing of PEG10 impaired the proliferation of villous trophoblasts and may interfere with the activity of extravillous trophoblasts. We further investigated the role of PEG10 in the proliferation, migration and invasion of JEG-3 trophoblast cell line and the primary chorionic villous cells. PEG10-silenced JEG-3 cells and primary chorionic villous cells displayed a reduced proliferation rate and impaired invasiveness in vitro. Silencing of PEG10 in trophoblast cells led to upregulated expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) as well as downregulated expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. Furthermore, knockdown of TIMP-1 reversed the suppressed invasiveness of PEG10 siRNA-transduced JEG-3 cells. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that PEG10 plays an important role in trophoblast proliferation and promotes trophoblast invasion through TIMP-1.},

  abstract = {Recent evidence shows that mutations in several driver genes can cause aberrant methylation patterns, a hallmark of cancer. In light of these findings, we hypothesized that the landscapes of tumor genomes and epigenomes are tightly interconnected. We measured this relationship using principal component analyses and methylation-mutation associations applied at the nucleotide level and with respect to genome-wide trends. We found that a few mutated driver genes were associated with genome-wide patterns of aberrant hypomethylation or CpG island hypermethylation in specific cancer types. In addition, we identified associations between 737 mutated driver genes and site-specific methylation changes. Moreover, using these mutation-methylation associations, we were able to distinguish between two uterine and two thyroid cancer subtypes. The driver gene mutation\textendash associated methylation differences between the thyroid cancer subtypes were linked to differential gene expression in JAK-STAT signaling, NADPH oxidation, and other cancer-related pathways. These results establish that driver gene mutations are associated with methylation alterations capable of shaping regulatory network functions. In addition, the methodology presented here can be used to subdivide tumors into more homogeneous subsets corresponding to underlying molecular characteristics, which could improve treatment efficacy., Mutations that alter the function of driver genes by changing DNA nucleotides have been recognized as key players in cancer progression. However, recent evidence has shown that DNA methylation, which can control gene expression, is also highly dysregulated in cancer and contributes to carcinogenesis. Whether methylation alterations correspond to mutated driver genes in cancer remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed 4,302 tumors from 18 cancer types and demonstrated that driver gene mutations are inherently connected with the aberrant DNA methylation landscape in cancer. We showed that driver gene\textendash associated methylation patterns can classify heterogeneous tumors within a cancer type into homogeneous subtypes and have the potential to influence genes that contribute to tumor growth. This finding could help us better understand the fundamental connection between driver gene mutations and DNA methylation alterations in cancer, and to further improve cancer treatment.},

In this study, we used reduced representation bisulfite sequencing to examine genome-wide DNA methylation variation in placental samples from offspring born IUGR, LGA, and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) and to identify differential methylation of genes important for conferring risk of cardiometabolic disease. We found that there were distinct methylation signatures for IUGR, LGA, and AGA groups and identified over 500 differentially methylated genes (DMGs) among these group comparisons. Functional and gene network analyses revealed expected relationships of DMGs to placental physiology and transport, but also identified novel pathways with biologic plausibility and potential clinical importance to cardiometabolic disease. Specific loci for DMGs of interest had methylation patterns that were strongly associated with anthropometric presentations. We further validated altered gene expression of these specific DMGs contributing to vascular and metabolic diseases (SLC36A1, PTPRN2, CASZ1, IL10), thereby establishing transcriptional effects toward assigning functional significance. Our results suggest that the gene expression and methylation state of the human placenta are related and sensitive to the intrauterine environment, as it affects fetal growth patterns. We speculate that these observed changes may affect risk for offspring in developing adult cardiometabolic disease.},

  abstract = {Background: Lung macrophages are major participants in the pulmonary innate immune response. In the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung, the inability of lung macrophages to successfully regulate the exaggerated inflammatory response suggests dysfunctional innate immune cell function. In this study, we aim to gain insight into innate immune cell dysfunction in CF by investigating alterations in DNA methylation in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells, composed primarily of lung macrophages of CF subjects compared with healthy controls. All analyses were performed using primary alveolar macrophages from human subjects collected via bronchoalveolar lavage. Epigenome-wide DNA methylation was examined via Illumina MethylationEPIC (850 K) array. Targeted next-generation bisulfite sequencing was used to validate selected differentially methylated CpGs. Methylation-based sample classification was performed using the recursively partitioned mixture model (RPMM) and was tested against sample case-control status. Differentially methylated loci were identified by fitting linear models with adjustment of age, sex, estimated cell type proportions, and repeat measurement. Results: RPMM class membership was significantly associated with the CF disease status (P = 0.026). One hundred nine CpG loci were differentially methylated in CF BAL cells (all FDR {$\leq$} 0.1). The majority of differentially methylated loci in CF were hypo-methylated and found within non-promoter CpG islands as well as in putative enhancer regions and DNase hyper-sensitive regions. Conclusions: These results support a hypothesis that epigenetic changes, specifically DNA methylation at a multitude of gene loci in lung macrophages, may participate, at least in part, in driving dysfunctional innate immune cells in the CF lung.},

  abstract = {Background: Phthalic acid esters are ubiquitous and antiandrogenic, and may cause systemic effects in humans, particularly with in utero exposure. Epigenetic modification, such as DNA methylation, has been hypothesized to be an important mechanism that mediates certain biological processes and pathogenic effects of in utero phthalate exposure. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the association between genome-wide DNA methylation at birth and prenatal exposure to phthalate. Methods: We studied 64 infant\textendash mother pairs included in TMICS (Taiwan Maternal and Infant Cohort Study), a long-term follow-up birth cohort from the general population. DNA methylation levels at more than 450,000 CpG sites were measured in cord blood samples using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. The concentrations of three metabolites of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) were measured using liquid chromatography tandem\textendash mass spectrometry (LC\textendash MS/MS) in urine samples collected from the pregnant women during 28\textendash 36 weeks gestation. Results: We identified 25 CpG sites whose methylation levels in cord blood were significantly correlated with prenatal DEHP exposure using a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5\% (q-value {$<$} 0.05). Via gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we also found that there was significant enrichment of genes involved in the androgen response, estrogen response, and spermatogenesis within those genes showing DNA methylation changes in response to exposure. Specifically, PA2G4, HMGCR, and XRCC6 genes were involved in genes in response to androgen. Conclusions: Phthalate exposure in utero may cause significant alterations in the DNA methylation in cord blood. These changes in DNA methylation might serve as biomarkers of maternal exposure to phthalate in infancy and potential candidates for studying mechanisms via which phthalate may impact on health in later life. Future investigations are warranted.},

  abstract = {Phthalates have a long industrial history. It is suspected that phthalates and their metabolites have detrimental effects on reproduction and development. They are well-known for their anti-androgenic effects. Several studies have indicated that phthalates and their metabolites are reprotoxic in males and endocrine disruptors. Reproduction and embryogenesis occur in the uterus of female eutherian mammals. A horizontal analytical method is preferred to elucidate the toxic effects of phthalates on human reproduction. Nevertheless, there are vast numbers of known phthalates and not all of their modes of action have been clarified. Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a commonly used plasticizer and has been the subject of numerous toxicological studies. However, few of these have reported on the toxic effects of DEHP, its metabolites, other phthalates, or mixtures on female reproduction. Acute and high doses of DEHP adversely affect uterine histology. Recently, it was disclosed that chronic exposures to low doses of DEHP have endocrine disruption efficacy. DEHP induces various cellular responses including modulation of the expression and regulation of steroid hormone receptors and transcription and paracrine factors. Uteri do not respond uniformly to DEHP exposure. The phenotypic manifestations and effects on fertility in response to DEHP and its metabolites may vary with species, developmental stage, and generation. Hence, DEHP exposure may histological alter the uterus and induce endometriosis, endometriosis, hyperplasia, myoma, and developmental and reproductive toxicity.},

Defects in the hypothalamus or pituitary gland can cause reduced growth and severe short stature, affecting approximately 1 in 4000 children, and a large percentage of cases of pituitary hormone deficiencies do not have an identified genetic cause. SOX21 is a protein that regulates hair, neural, and trophoblast stem cell differentiation. Mice lacking Sox21 have reduced growth, but the etiology of this growth defect has not been described. We studied the expression of Sox21 in hypothalamic-pituitary development and examined multiple endocrine axes in these mice. We find no evidence of reduced intrauterine growth, food intake, or physical activity, but there is evidence for increased energy expenditure in mutants. In addition, despite changes in pituitary hormone expression, hypothalamic-pituitary axes appear to be functional. Therefore, SOX21 variants may be a cause of non-endocrine short stature in humans.},

  abstract = {Several approaches have been proposed to correct point-wise signi\textregistered cance thresholds used in intervalmapping genome scans. A method for signi\textregistered cance threshold correction based on the Bonferroni test is presented. This test involves calculating the eective number of independent comparisons performed in a genome scan from the variance of the eigenvalues of the observed marker correlation matrix. The more highly correlated the markers, the higher the variance of the eigenvalues and the lower the number of independent tests performed on a chromosome. This approach was evaluated by mapping 1000 normally distributed phenotypes along chromosomes of varying length and marker density in a population size of 500. Experiment-wise signi\textregistered cance thresholds obtained from the simulation are compared to those calculated using the Bonferroni criterion and the newly developed measure of the eective number of independent tests in a genome scan. The Bonferroni calculation produced signi\textregistered cance thresholds very similar to those obtained by simulation. The threshold levels for both Bonferroni and simulation analysis depended strongly on the marker density and size of chromosomes. There was a slight bias of about 1\% in the thresholds obtained at the 5\% and 10\% point-wise signi\textregistered cance levels. The method introduced here provides a relatively simple correction for multiple comparisons that can be easily calculated using standard statistics packages.},

  abstract = {Objectives We applied three statistical approaches for evaluating associations between prenatal urinary concentrations of a mixture of phthalate metabolites and birth weight. Methods We included 300 women who provided 732 urine samples during pregnancy and delivered a singleton infant. We measured urinary concentrations of metabolites of di(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate, di-isobutyl-, di-n-butyl-, butylbenzyl-, and diethyl phthalates. We applied 1) linear regressions; 2) classification methods [principal component analysis (PCA) and structural equation models (SEM)]; and 3) Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR), to evaluate associations between phthalate metabolite mixtures and birth weight adjusting for potential confounders. Data were presented as mean differences (95\%CI) in birth weight (grams) as each phthalate increased from the 10th to the 90th percentile. Results When analyzing individual phthalate metabolites using linear regressions, each metabolite demonstrated a modest inverse association with birth weight [from -93 (-206, 21) to -49 (-164, 65)]. When simultaneously including all metabolites in a multivariable model, inflation of the estimates and standard errors were noted. PCA identified two principal components, both inversely associated with birth weight [-23 (-68, 22), -27 (-71, 17), respectively]. These inverse associations were confirmed when applying SEM. BKMR further identified that monoethyl and mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and phthalate concentrations were linearly related to lower birth weight [-51(-164, 63) and -122 (-311, 67), respectively], and suggested no evidence of interaction between metabolites. Conclusions While none of the methods produced significant results, we demonstrated the potential issues arising using linear regression models in the context of correlated exposures. Among the other selected approaches, classification techniques identified common sources of exposures with implications for interventions, while BKMR further identified specific contributions of individual metabolites.},

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the relationship between the urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites and children's intellectual functioning. METHODS: This study enrolled 667 children at nine elementary schools in five South Korean cities. A cross-sectional examination of urine phthalate concentrations was performed, and scores on neuropsychological tests were obtained from both the children and their mothers. RESULTS: We measured mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) and mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl)phthalate (MEOHP), both metabolites of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP), a metabolite of dibutyl phthalate (DBP), in urine samples. The geometric mean (ln) concentrations of MEHP, MEOHP, and MBP were 21.3 microg/L [geometric SD (GSD) = 2.2 microg/L; range, 0.5-445.4], 18.0 microg/L (GSD = 2.4; range, 0.07-291.1), and 48.9 microg/L (GSD = 2.2; range, 2.1-1645.5), respectively. After adjusting for demographic and developmental covariates, the Full Scale IQ and Verbal IQ scores were negatively associated with DEHP metabolites but not with DBP metabolites. We also found a significant negative relationship between the urine concentrations of the metabolites of DEHP and DBP and children's vocabulary subscores. After controlling for maternal IQ, a significant inverse relationship between DEHP metabolites and vocabulary subscale score remained. Among boys, we found a negative association between increasing MEHP phthalate concentrations and the sum of DEHP metabolite concentrations and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children vocabulary score; however, among girls, we found no significant association between these variables. CONCLUSION: Controlling for maternal IQ and other covariates, the results show an inverse relationship between phthalate metabolites and IQ scores; however, given the limitations in cross-sectional epidemiology, prospective studies are needed to fully explore these associations.},

Both ART and germline defects associated with parental infertility could interfere with epigenetic reprogramming events in germ cells or early embryos. Mouse models indicate that the placenta is more susceptible to the induction of epigenetic abnormalities than the embryo, and thus the placental methylome may provide a sensitive indicator of 'at risk' conceptuses. Our goal was to use genome-wide profiling to examine the extent of epigenetic abnormalities in matched placentas from an ART/infertility group and control singleton pregnancies (n~=~44/group) from a human prospective longitudinal birth cohort, the Design, Develop, Discover (3D) Study. Principal component analysis revealed a group of ART outliers. The ART outlier group was enriched for females and a subset of placentas showing loss of methylation of several imprinted genes including GNAS, SGCE, KCNQT1OT1 and BLCAP/NNAT. Within the ART group, placentas from pregnancies conceived with in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) showed distinct epigenetic profiles as compared to those conceived with less invasive procedures (ovulation induction, intrauterine insemination). Male factor infertility and paternal age further differentiated the IVF/ICSI group, suggesting an interaction of infertility and techniques in perturbing the placental epigenome. Together, the results suggest that the human placenta is sensitive to the induction of epigenetic defects by ART and/or infertility, and we stress the importance of considering both sex and paternal factors and that some but not all ART conceptuses will be susceptible.},

  abstract = {The use of human biomonitoring data to characterize exposure to environmental contaminants in epidemiology studies has expanded greatly in recent years. Substantial variability in effect measures may arise when using different exposure metrics for a given contaminant, and it is often not clear which metric is the best surrogate for the `causal' or `true' exposure. Here we evaluated variability and potential bias in epidemiologic associations resulting from the use of different phthalate exposure metrics in the 2009\textendash 2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We examined associations between urinary phthalate metabolites and the outcomes of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC). We examined each of the following NHANES-derived exposure metrics for metabolites of individual phthalates: molar excretion rate (nmol/min), molar amount (nmol), molar concentration (nmol/mL, with and without additional model adjustment for creatinine), creatinine corrected molar concentration (nmol/g creatinine), and reconstructed daily phthalate intake (nmol/kg/day). In order to investigate potential biasing effect of each metric, we first assumed that daily intake of the parent phthalate is the causal exposure. We then constructed a simulated population based on the 2009\textendash 2010 NHANES, and randomly assigned each individual a di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) intake dose based on a published distribution, but independent of any other factor. Accordingly, all associations between these randomly assigned intake doses and individuals' BMI and WC should be null. Next, demographic data in the NHANES were incorporated into a pharmacokinetic model to predict urinary molar excretions of five DEHP metabolites based on the randomly assigned DEHP intake. The predicted molar excretions were then used to calculate the same exposure metrics listed above. Three exposure metrics (randomly generated intake, excretion rate, urine concentration) showed no significant associations with BMI, which supports the null hypothesis stated above. In contrast, metrics adjusted for creatinine showed a significant negative correlation, and reconstructed daily intake showed a significant positive correlation, indicating the introduction of bias away from the true (i.e., null) association. Interestingly, trends in the simulation analysis were similar to those seen in the observed NHANES data. Our findings show that, at least in this example case, the choice of exposure metric can introduce significant bias of varying magnitude and direction into the calculation of epidemiologic associations.},

Two major areas of epigenetics\textemdash DNA methylation and histone modifications\textemdash are known to have profound effects on controlling gene expression. DNA methylation is involved in normal cellular control of expression, and aberrant hypermethylation can lead to silencing of tumor-suppressor genes in carcinogenesis. Histone modifications control the accessibility of the chromatin and transcriptional activities inside a cell. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules, {$\sim$}22 nucleotides long that can negatively control their target gene expression posttranscriptionally. There are currently more than 460 human miRNAs known, and the total number is predicted to be much larger. Recently, the expression of miRNAs has been definitively linked to cancer development, and miRNA profiles can be used to classify human cancers. miRNAs are encoded in our genome and are generally transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Despite the growing evidence for their importance in normal physiology, little is known about the regulation of miRNA expression. In this review, we will examine the relationship between miRNAs and epigenetics. We examine the effects of miRNAs on epigenetic machinery, and the control of miRNA expression by epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetics is defined as heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve a change in DNA sequence.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Exposome-wide association studies (EWAS) are a systematic and unbiased way to investigate multiple environmental factors associated with phenotype. We applied EWAS to study semen quality and queried the sample size requirements to detect modest associations in a reproductive cohort. Study design and setting: We conducted 1) a multivariate EWAS of 128 endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) from 15 chemical classes measured in urine/serum relative to 7 semen quality endpoints in a prospective cohort study comprising 473 men and 2) estimated the sample size requirements for EWAS etiologic investigations. Results: None of the EDCs were associated with semen quality endpoints after adjusting for multiple tests. However, several EDCs (e.g., polychlorinated biphenyl congeners 99, 105, 114, and 167) were associated with raw p {$<$} 0.05. In a post hoc statistical power analysis with the observed effect sizes, we determined that EWAS research in male fertility will require a mean sample size of 2696 men (1795\textendash 3625) to attain a power of 0.8. The average size of four published studies is 201 men. Conclusion: Existing cohort studies with hundreds of participants are underpowered ({$<$} 0.8) for EWAS-related investigations. Merging cohorts to ensure a sufficient sample size can facilitate the use of EWAS methods for assessing EDC mixtures that impact semen quality.},

  abstract = {Background:It has been estimated that a substantial portion of chronic and noncommunicable diseases can be caused or exacerbated by exposure to environmental chemicals. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that early life exposure to environmental chemicals at relatively low concentrations could have lasting effects on individual and population health. Although the potential adverse effects of environmental chemicals are known to the scientific community, regulatory agencies, and the public, little is known about the mechanistic basis by which these chemicals can induce long-term or transgenerational effects. To address this question, epigenetic mechanisms have emerged as the potential link between genetic and environmental factors of health and disease.Objectives:We present an overview of epigenetic regulation and a summary of reported evidence of environmental toxicants as epigenetic disruptors. We also discuss the advantages and challenges of using epigenetic biomarkers as an indicator of toxicant exposure, using measures that can be taken to improve risk assessment, and our perspectives on the future role of epigenetics in toxicology.Discussion:Until recently, efforts to apply epigenomic data in toxicology and risk assessment were restricted by an incomplete understanding of epigenomic variability across tissue types and populations. This is poised to change with the development of new tools and concerted efforts by researchers across disciplines that have led to a better understanding of epigenetic mechanisms and comprehensive maps of epigenomic variation. With the foundations now in place, we foresee that unprecedented advancements will take place in the field in the coming years.  https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6104},

  abstract = {Circadian disruption is a common environmental and occupational exposure with public health consequences, but not much is known about whether circadian disruption affects in utero development. We investigated whether maternal circadian disruption, using night shift work as a proxy, is associated with variations in DNA methylation patterns of placental tissue in an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of night shift work. Here, we compared cytosine-guanosine dinucleotide (CpG) specific methylation genome-wide of placental tissue (measured with the Illumina 450K array) from participants (n = 237) in the Rhode Island Child Health Study (RICHS) who did (n = 53) and did not (n = 184) report working the night shift, using robust linear modeling and adjusting for maternal age, pre-pregnancy smoking, infant sex, maternal adversity, and putative cell mixture. Statistical analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons and results presented with Bonferroni or Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) adjustment for false discovery rate. Night shift work was associated with differential methylation in placental tissue, including CpG sites in the genes NAV1, SMPD1, TAPBP, CLEC16A, DIP2C, FAM172A, and PLEKHG6 (Bonferroni-adjusted p{$<$}0.05). CpG sites within NAV1, MXRA8, GABRG1, PRDM16, WNT5A, and FOXG1 exhibited the most hypomethylation, while CpG sites within TDO2, ADAMTSL3, DLX2, and SERPINA1 exhibited the most hypermethylation (BH q{$<$}0.10). Functional analysis indicated GO-terms associated with cell-cell adhesion and enriched GWAS results for psoriasis. Night shift work was associated with differential methylation of the placenta, which may have implications for fetal health and development. This is the first study to examine the epigenetic impacts of night shift exposure, as a proxy for circadian disruption, on placental methylation in humans, and, while results should be interpreted with caution, suggests circadian disruption may have epigenetic impacts.},

PHP1B can follow an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance or occur sporadically (spor-PHP1B). These latter patients present broad methylation changes of two or more differentially methylated regions (DMR) that, when mimicking the paternal allele, raises the suspicious of the occurrence of paternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 20 (upd(20)pat)., A cohort of 33 spor-PHP1B patients was screened for upd(20)pat using comparative genomic hybridization with SNP-chip. Methylation analyses were assessed by methylation specific-multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Upd(20)pat was identified in 6 patients, all exhibiting typical paternal methylation pattern compared to normal controls, namely a complete loss of methylation of GNAS A/B:TSS-DMR, negligible methylation at GNAS-AS1 :TSS-DMR and GNAS-XL:Ex1-DMR and complete gain of methylation at GNAS-NESP:TSS-DMR. The overall frequency of upd(20) is 18\% in our cohort when searched considering both severe and partial loss of imprinting. However, twenty five patients displayed severe methylation pattern and the upd(20)pat frequency reaches 24\% when searching in this group. Consequently, up to day, upd(20)pat is the most common anomaly than other genetic alterations in spor-PHP1B patients., Upd(20)pat occurrence is not linked to the parental age in contrast to upd(20)mat, strongly associated with an advanced maternal childbearing age., This study provides criteria to guide further investigations for upd(20)pat needed for an adequate genetic counseling.},

The most commonly detected PFAS, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), has been classified as a persistent and bioaccumulative substance. Similarities in chemical structure and environmental behavior of PFOS and the PFCAs that have been detected in wildlife have generated concerns about the bioaccumulation potential of PFCAs. Differences between partitioning behavior of perfluorinated acids and persistent lipophilic compounds complicate the understanding of PFCA bioaccumulation and the subsequent classification of the bioaccumulation potential of PFCAs according to existing regulatory criteria. Based on available research on the bioaccumulation of perfluorinated acids, five key points are highlighted in this review: (1) bioconcentration and bioaccumulation of perfluorinated acids are directly related to the length of each compound's fluorinated carbon chain; (2) PFASs are more bioaccumulative than PFCAs of the same fluorinated carbon chain length; (3) PFCAs with seven fluorinated carbons or less (perfluorooctanoate (PFO) and shorter PFCAs) are not considered bioaccumulative according to the range of promulgated bioaccumulation,"B", regulatory criteria of 1000-5000 L/kg; (4) PFCAs with seven fluorinated carbons or less have low biomagnification potential in food webs, and (5) more research is necessary to fully characterize the bioaccumulation potential of PFCAs with longer fluorinated carbon chains ({$>$}7 fluorinated carbons), as PFCAs with longer fluorinated carbon chains may exhibit partitioning behavior similar to or greater than PFOS. The bioaccumulation potential of perfluorinated acids with seven fluorinated carbons or less appears to be several orders of magnitude lower than "legacy" persistent lipophilic compounds classified as bioaccumulative. Thus, although many PFCAs are environmentally persistent and can be present at detectable concentrations in wildlife, it is clear that PFCAs with seven fluorinated carbons or less (including PFO) are not bioaccumulative according to regulatory criteria.},

  abstract = {This paper is about the co-clustering of ordinal data. Such data are very common on e-commerce platforms where customers rank the products/services they bought. More in details, we focus on arrays of ordinal (possibly missing) data involving two disjoint sets of individuals/objects corresponding to the rows/columns of the arrays. Typically, an observed entry (i, j) in the array is an ordinal score assigned by the individual/row i to the object/column j. A generative model for arrays of ordinal data is introduced along with an inference algorithm for parameters estimation. The model relies on latent continuous random variables and the fitting allows to simultaneously co-cluster the rows and columns of an array. The estimation of the model parameters is performed via a classification expectation maximization (C-EM) algorithm. A model selection criterion is formally obtained to select the number of row and column clusters. In order to show that our approach reaches and often outperforms the state of the art, we carry out numerical experiments on synthetic data. Finally, applications on real datasets highlight the model capacity to deal with very sparse arrays.},

  abstract = {This study was based on the hypothesis that IL-1{$\beta$} and its central regulator, the inflammasome, may play a role in the inflammatory condition exhibited by placental tissues from mothers with different gestational hyperglycemia levels. Pregnant women were classified according to the glycemic reference as non-diabetic (n = 15), mild gestational hyperglycemia (n = 15), gestational diabetes mellitus (n = 15) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 15). We investigated levels of pro-inflammatory factors in maternal plasma and placental tissues (by ELISA or immunohistochemistry) and, NFKB activity (by electrophoretic mobility shift assay) and inflammasome protein expression (by Western blot) in chorionic villous. Maternal plasma and placental levels of inflammatory factors (IL-1{$\beta$}, IL-6, and MCP-1) were increased during all hyperglycemic conditions. Villous stroma cells showed strong immunoreactivity to CD68. In addition, with syncytiotrophoblast, the villous stroma cells were also stained to detect iNOS, MCP-1, TLR2, and TLR4. Although the levels of protein had fluctuated in the groups, NLRP1, NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase 1 were up-regulated in all hyperglycemic groups suggesting the inflammasome may be assembled in these pregnant women. The NFKB activity also exhibited higher levels in hyperglycemic groups, which might imply in pro-inflammatory cytokines production. In summary, increased maternal glucose levels during pregnancy changed systemic and placental inflammatory patterns, which occurred in parallel with the expression of inflammasome factors and processing and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1{$\beta$}. These results suggest an inflammatory condition in all gestational hyperglycemic conditions, even in hyperglycemia that is less severe than gestational or overt diabetes, likely associated with inflammasome activation and inflammatory cytokine secretion. Inflammasome activation as a possible source of inflammatory factors may be an important target to be considered while managing hyperglycemia and preventing adverse pregnancy outcomes.},

Results Six genes with differential expression, namely FALZ, PAPP-A, PRKACB, SAV1, STK4 and TNXB2, were found. The ROC curve yielded a detection rate of 66.7\% at a false positive rate of 10\%. A higher discriminant score ({$>$}75th centile) was reached for 14 CHD cases (82.4\%) and only 1 control (5.8\%). Two cases (11.8\%) of heart rhythm disorders also yielded a discriminant score value {$>$}75th centile. Conclusion These data represent a step forward in the screening of CHDs. Additional studies are needed to detect more mRNAs with discriminant ability and to move the first trimester screening.},

  abstract = {Background: Imprinted genes show expression from one parental allele only and are important for development and behaviour. This extreme mode of allelic imbalance has been described for approximately 56 human genes. Imprinting status is often disrupted in cancer and dysmorphic syndromes. More subtle variation of gene expression, that is not parent-of-origin specific, termed 'allele-specific gene expression' (ASE) is more common and may give rise to milder phenotypic differences. Using two allele-specific high-throughput technologies alongside bioinformatics predictions, normal term human placenta was screened to find new imprinted genes and to ascertain the extent of ASE in this tissue. Results: Twenty-three family trios of placental cDNA, placental genomic DNA (gDNA) and gDNA from both parents were tested for 130 candidate genes with the Sequenom MassArray system. Six genes were found differentially expressed but none imprinted. The Illumina ASE BeadArray platform was then used to test 1536 SNPs in 932 genes. The array was enriched for the human orthologues of 124 mouse candidate genes from bioinformatics predictions and 10 human candidate imprinted genes from EST database mining. After quality control pruning, a total of 261 informative SNPs (214 genes) remained for analysis. Imprinting with maternal expression was demonstrated for the lymphocyte imprinted gene ZNF331 in human placenta. Two potential differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were found in the vicinity of ZNF331. None of the bioinformatically predicted candidates tested showed imprinting except for a skewed allelic expression in a parent-specific manner observed for PHACTR2, a neighbour of the imprinted PLAGL1 gene. ASE was detected for two or more individuals in 39 candidate genes (18\%). Conclusions: Both Sequenom and Illumina assays were sensitive enough to study imprinting and strong allelic bias. Previous bioinformatics approaches were not predictive of new imprinted genes in the human term placenta. ZNF331 is imprinted in human term placenta and might be a new ubiquitously imprinted gene, part of a primate-specific locus. Demonstration of partial imprinting of PHACTR2 calls for re-evaluation of the allelic pattern of expression for the PHACTR2-PLAGL1 locus. ASE was common in human term placenta.},

  abstract = {In this review, the sugar portions of glycoproteins, glycolipids, and glycosaminoglycans constitute the glycome, and the genes involved in their biosynthesis, degradation, transport and recognition are referred to as ``glycogenes``. The extreme complexity of the glycome requires the regulatory layer to be provided by the epigenetic mechanisms. Almost all types of cancers present glycosylation aberrations, giving rise to phenotypic changes and to the expression of tumor markers. In this review, we discuss how cancer-associated alterations of promoter methylation, histone methylation/acetylation, and miRNAs determine glycomic changes associated with the malignant phenotype. Usually, increased promoter methylation and miRNA expression induce glycogene silencing. However, treatment with demethylating agents sometimes results in silencing, rather than in a reactivation of glycogenes, suggesting the involvement of distant methylation-dependent regulatory elements. From a therapeutic perspective aimed at the normalization of the malignant glycome, it appears that miRNA targeting of cancer-deranged glycogenes can be a more specific and promising approach than the use of drugs, which broad target methylation/acetylation. A very specific type of glycosylation, the addition of GlcNAc to serine or threonine (O-GlcNAc), is not only regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, but is an epigenetic modifier of histones and transcription factors. Thus, glycosylation is both under the control of epigenetic mechanisms and is an integral part of the epigenetic code.},

  abstract = {It has been established that the permeability of the human placenta increases with advancing gestation. Indirect evidence has also proposed that aquaporins (AQPs) may be involved in the regulation of placental water flow but the mechanisms are poorly understood. Five AQPs have been found in the human placenta and fetal membranes [AQP1, 3, 4, 8 and 9]. However, the physiological function(s) and the regulation of these proteins remain unknown. Emerging evidence has shown that human fetal membrane AQPs may have a role in intramembranous amniotic fluid water regulation and that alterations in their expression are related to polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios. In addition, we have observed a high expression of AQP3 and AQP9 in the apical membrane of the syncytiotrophoblast. Moreover, AQP9 was found to be increased in preeclamptic placentas, but it could not be related to its functionality for the transport of water and mannitol. However, a significant urea flux was seen. Since preeclampsia is not known to be associated with an altered water flux to the fetus we propose that AQP9 might not have a key role in water transport in human placenta, but a function in the energy metabolism or the urea uptake and elimination across the placenta. However, the role of AQP9 in human placenta is still speculative and needs further studies. Insulin, hCG, cAMP and CFTR have been found to be involved in the regulation of the molecular and functional expression of AQPs. Further insights into these mechanisms may clarify how water moves between the mother and the fetus.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Phthalates are a group of high production chemicals, generally used as plasticizers and odor enhancers. Phthalates cross the blood-placenta barrier and are associated with deficits in cognitive functions and behavior problems in offspring. We previously reported sex-specific associations with motor function when phthalates are considered singly. Because exposure to phthalates usually occurs as mixtures, here we assess these associations between a mixture of phthalates and motor function at age 11~years. METHODS: Data come from the prospective cohort study of mothers and offspring who participated in the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health birth cohort (CCCEH). Seven phthalate metabolites were measured in maternal spot urine obtained during the third trimester and motor function was evaluated using the short form of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, 2nd edition (BOT-2) at the age of 11~years. We used Weighted Quartile Sum (WQS) regression models to examine the effect of phthalate metabolites in males and females separately. The models were adjusted for child age in months, child BMI, maternal race (African-American vs. Dominican), prenatal alcohol consumption, maternal demoralization score, HOME score, and urine specific gravity. In a secondary analysis we used linear regression models to examine the association between the sum of molar concentrations of both DEHP and non-DEHP metabolites, and outcomes of gross and fine motor functions. RESULTS: 209 mother-child pairs were eligible for this analysis. A significant decrease in fine-motor functions was observed among females, but not among males, following exposure to high levels of weighted quartile sum of seven phthalate metabolites (Covariates-adjusted coefficient estimate B~=~-2.7, 95\% Confidence Interval [CI] -4.64 to -0.75, p~=~0.01 for females [n~=~116] and B~=~-1.63, 95\%CI -3.94 to 0.69, p~=~0.16 for males [n~=~93]). The most highly weighted phthalate metabolites, associated with fine-motor functions among females, were MBP, MBZP, and MIBP, all non-DEHP phthalates. No significant associations were found between the weighted quartile sum of seven phthalate metabolites and gross-motor functions at the age of 11~years for males (B~=~-0.81, 95\%CI -1.17 to 1.96, p~=~0.23). With the molar sum of four non-DEHP phthalates as main predictor of linear regression models, we found significant decrease in gross and fine motor functions among females prenatally exposed to non-DEHP phthalates B~=~-0.98, 95\%CI -1.98 to 0.03, p~=~0.05 and B~=~-0.85, 95\%CI -1.49 to -0.20, p~=~0.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Phthalate exposure during pregnancy was associated with decreased motor functions among 11-year-old girls.},

  abstract = {Triclosan [5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol; TCS] is a broad spectrum antibacterial agent used in personal care, veterinary, industrial and household products. TCS is commonly detected in aquatic ecosystems, as it is only partially removed during the wastewater treatment process. Sorption, biodegradation and photolytic degradation mitigate the availability of TCS to aquatic biota; however the by-products such as methyltriclosan and other chlorinated phenols may be more resistant to degradation and have higher toxicity than the parent compound. The continuous exposure of aquatic organisms to TCS, coupled with its bioaccumulation potential, have led to detectable levels of the antimicrobial in a number of aquatic species. TCS has been also detected in breast milk, urine and plasma, with levels of TCS in the blood correlating with consumer use patterns of the antimicrobial. Mammalian systemic toxicity studies indicate that TCS is neither acutely toxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic, nor a developmental toxicant. Recently, however, concern has been raised over TCS's potential for endocrine disruption, as the antimicrobial has been shown to disrupt thyroid hormone homeostasis and possibly the reproductive axis. Moreover, there is strong evidence that aquatic species such as algae, invertebrates and certain types of fish are much more sensitive to TCS than mammals. TCS is highly toxic to algae and exerts reproductive and developmental effects in some fish. The potential for endocrine disruption and antibiotic cross-resistance highlights the importance of the judicious use of TCS, whereby the use of TCS should be limited to applications where it has been shown to be effective.},

We summarize here different approaches applied in the Data Mining and Machine Learning group at the GAW20 to integrate genome-wide genotype and methylation array data. Results: We provide a non-intimidating introduction to some frequently used methods to investigate highdimensional molecular data and compare the different approaches tried by group members: random forest, deep learning, cluster analysis, mixed models, and gene-set enrichment analysis. Group contributions were quite heterogeneous regarding investigated data sets (real vs simulated), conducted data quality control and assessed phenotypes (eg, metabolic syndrome vs relative differences of log-transformed triglyceride concentrations before and after fenofibrate treatment). However, some common technical issues were detected, leading to practical recommendations. Conclusions: Different sources of correlation were identified by group members, including population stratification, family structure, batch effects, linkage disequilibrium and correlation of methylation values at neighboring cytosinephosphate-guanine (CpG) sites, and the majority of applied approaches were able to take into account identified correlation structures. The ability to efficiently deal with high-dimensional omics data, and the model free nature of the approaches that did not require detailed model specifications were clearly recognized as the main strengths of applied methods. A limitation of random forest is its sensitivity to highly correlated variables. The parameter setup and the interpretation of results from deep learning methods, in particular deep neural networks, can be extremely challenging. Cluster analysis and mixed models may need some predimension reduction based on existing literature, data filtering, and supplementary statistical methods, and gene-set enrichment analysis requires biological insight.},

The present review focuses on early exposure to environmental chemicals as a risk factor for neurodevelopment, and presents the major lines of evidence derived from epidemiological studies, underlying key uncertainties and research needs in this field. We introduce the exposome concept that, encompassing the totality of human environmental exposures to multiple risk factors, aims at explaining individual vulnerability and resilience to early chemical exposure. In this framework, we synthetically review the role of variable gene backgrounds, the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms as well as the function played by potential effect modifiers such as socioeconomic status. We describe laboratory rodent studies where the neurodevelopmental effects of environmental chemicals are assessed in the presence of either a ``vulnerable'' gene background or adverse pregnancy conditions (i.e., maternal stress). Finally, we discuss the need for more descriptive and ``lifelike'' experimental models of NDDs, to identify candidate biomarkers and pinpoint susceptible groups or life stages to be translated to large prospective studies within the exposome framework.},

  abstract = {Background: Bisphenol A (BPA) is an environmental compounds is known to possess endocrine disruption potentials. Bisphenol A has epigenetic effects as deregulated expression of microRNAs; such epigenetic marks can induce up/down alterations in gene expression that may persist throughout a lifetime. Bisphenol A (BPA) exposure has been documented in pregnant women, but consequences for development of offspring after BPA exposure during pregnancy are not yet widely studied. Therefore, the aim of this study was to gain a comprehensive understanding of microRNAs changes in the placenta transcriptome from pregnant women subjected to therapeutic abortion for fetal malformation and correlate the impact of gestational exposure to BPA on these developmental changes. Methods: We performed a comparative analysis of genome wide miRNA expression in placentas from pregnant women exposed to BPA using microarray technology to identify miRNAs which were aberrantly expressed in placentas from malformed fetuses. The expression changes of differential expressed miRNAs in the samples used for microarray were confirmed by qPCR . Beside, we applied various bioinformatics tools to predict the target genes of the identified miR-146a and explore their biological function and downstream pathways. Results: We found that miR-146a was significant overexpressed and correlated significantly with BPA accumulation in the placenta from pregnant women living in a polluted area and undergoing therapeutic abortion due to fetal malformations. Beside, we applied various bioinformatics tools to predict the target genes of miR-146a and explore their biological function and downstream pathways. Conclusions: For the first time, we found, in humans, that miR-146a was significant over-expressed and correlated significantly with BPA accumulation in the placenta. Our results lead to the suggestion that miRNAs could be potential biomarkers to clarify the mechanisms of environmental diseases.},

Methods based on statistical tests that incorporate expression level variability are used more commonly than those based on fold change (FC). However, FC based results are more reproducible and biologically relevant. Results: We propose a new method based on fold change rank ordering statistics (FCROS). We exploit the variation in calculated FC levels using combinatorial pairs of biological conditions in the datasets. A statistic is associated with the ranks of the FC values for each gene, and the resulting probability is used to identify the DE genes within an error level. The FCROS method is deterministic, requires a low computational runtime and also solves the problem of multiple tests which usually arises with microarray datasets. Conclusion: We compared the performance of FCROS with those of other methods using synthetic and real microarray datasets. We found that FCROS is well suited for DE gene identification from noisy datasets when compared with existing FC based methods.},

  abstract = {Background Bisphenols and triclosan are considered as potential thyroid disruptors. While mild alterations in maternal thyroid function can result in adverse pregnancy and child developmental outcomes, there is still uncertainty whether bisphenols or triclosan can interfere with thyroid function during pregnancy. Objectives We aimed to investigate the association of urinary bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol F (BPF) and triclosan with early pregnancy thyroid function. Methods This study was embedded in the Swedish Environmental Longitudinal, Mother and child, Asthma and allergy study (SELMA), a population-based prospective pregnancy cohort. In total, 1996 participants were included in the current study. Maternal urinary concentrations of three bisphenols and triclosan, collected at median (95\% range) 10 (6\textendash 14) weeks of pregnancy as well as serum concentrations of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), free triiodothyronine (FT3), total thyroxine (TT4), and total triiodothyronine (TT3) were measured. Results Higher BPA levels were associated with lower TT4 concentrations (non-monotonic, P = 0.03), a lower FT4/FT3 ratio ({$\beta$} [SE] -0.02 [0.01], P = 0.03) and a lower TT4/TT3 ratio ({$\beta$} [SE] -0.73 [0.27], P = 0.008). Higher BPF levels were associated with a higher FT3 ({$\beta$} [SE] 0.01 [0.007], P = 0.04). There were no associations between other bisphenols or triclosan and absolute TSH, (F)T4 or (F)T3 concentrations. The association of BPA with thyroid function differed with gestational age. The negative association of BPA with FT4/FT3 and TT4/TT3 ratios was only apparent in early but not late gestation (P for interaction: 0.003, 0.008, respectively). Conclusion These human data during pregnancy substantiate experimental findings suggesting that BPA could potentially affect thyroid function and deiodinase activities in early gestation.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the third in a series illustrating the power of generalized linear models (GLMs) for the astronomical community, we elucidate the potential of the class of GLMs which handles count data. The size of a galaxy's globular cluster (GC) population (NGC) is a prolonged puzzle in the astronomical literature. It falls in the category of count data analysis, yet it is usually modelled as if it were a continuous response variable. We have developed a Bayesian negative binomial regression model to study the connection between NGC and the following galaxy properties: central black hole mass, dynamical bulge mass, bulge velocity dispersion and absolute visual magnitude. The methodology introduced herein naturally accounts for heteroscedasticity, intrinsic scatter, errors in measurements in both axes (either discrete or continuous) and allows modelling the population of GCs on their natural scale as a nonnegative integer variable. Prediction intervals of 99 per cent around the trend for expected NGC comfortably envelope the data, notably including the Milky Way, which has hitherto been considered a problematic outlier. Finally, we demonstrate how random intercept models can incorporate information of each particular galaxy morphological type. Bayesian variable selection methodology allows for automatically identifying galaxy types with different productions of GCs, suggesting that on average S0 galaxies have a GC population 35 per cent smaller than other types with similar brightness.},

  abstract = {Phenolic compounds are among the endocrine disruptors which are widely used in daily life products. Studies in laboratory animals showed reproductive and developmental effects. In spite of widespread exposure to phenols, only few studies examined their effects on human development. This study was designed to investigate the relationship between antenatal phenol exposure and birth outcomes in a Chinese obstetric population. Four hundred ninety-six mother-infant pairs recruited from the Laizhou Wan prospective birth cohort in northern China between 2010 and 2013 were included in the study. We measured two phenol metabolites in maternal urine at delivery and examined their associations with birth outcomes including birth weight, crown\textendash heel length, head circumference, gestational age, and ponderal index. Median levels of bisphenol A (BPA) and triclosan (TCS) in urine were 1.07 and 0.50 {$\mu$}g/g creatinine, respectively. After adjusting for confounders, a 10-fold increase in BPA levels was associated with a 0.63 cm [95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.25 to 1.01] increase in birth length among boys, but not among girls. No associations were found between TCS levels and any birth outcomes. The positive association of prenatal low-level BPA exposures with anthropometric measures observed among boys, suggests gender differences in the response to antenatal phenol exposure. Given the variability in urinary phenol levels reported during pregnancy, our findings based on levels of the target biomarkers in a single urine sample need to be confirmed in additional studies.},

  abstract = {Genomic imprinting refers to silencing of one parental allele in the zygotes of gametes depending upon the parent of origin. Loss of imprinting (LOI) is the gain of function from the silent allele that can have a maximum effect of doubling the gene dosage. LOI may play a significant role in the etiology of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Using placental tissue from ten normal and seven IUGR pregnancies, we conducted a systematic survey of the expression of a panel of 74 "putatively" imprinted genes using quantitative RT-PCR. We found that 52/74 ( approximately 70\%) of the genes were expressed in human placentas. Nine of the 52 (17\%) expressed genes were significantly differentially expressed between normal and IUGR placentas; five were upregulated (PHLDA2, ILK2, NNAT, CCDC86, PEG10) and four downregulated (PLAGL1, DHCR24, ZNF331, CDKAL1). We also assessed LOI profile of 14 imprinted genes in 14 normal and 24 IUGR placentas using a functional and sensitive assay developed in our laboratory. Little LOI was observed in any placentas for five of the genes (PEG10, PHLDA2, MEG3, EPS15, CD44). With the 149 heterozygosities examined, 40 (26.8\%) exhibited LOI {$>$}3\%. Some genes exhibited frequent LOI in placentas regardless of the disease status (IGF2, TP73, MEST, SLC22A18, PEG3), while others exhibited LOI only in IUGR placentas (PLAGL1, DLK1, H19, SNRPN). Importantly, there was no correlation between gene expression and LOI profile. Our study suggests that genomic imprinting may play a role in IUGR pathogenesis, but mechanisms other than LOI may contribute to dysregulation of imprinted genes.},

More than half of these DMRs have cell type-restricted ASM, and among them are 188 hap-ASM DMRs and 933 mQTLs located near GWAS signals for immune and neurological disorders. Targeted bis-seq confirmed hap-ASM in 12/13 loci tested, including CCDC155, CD69, FRMD1, IRF1, KBTBD11, and S100A({${_\ast}$})-ILF2, associated with immune phenotypes, MYT1L, PTPRN2, CMTM8 and CELF2, associated with neurological disorders, NGFR and HLA-DRB6, associated with both immunological and brain disorders, and ZFP57, a trans-acting regulator of genomic imprinting. Polymorphic CTCF and transcription factor (TF) binding sites were over-represented among hap-ASM DMRs and mQTLs, and analysis of the human data, supplemented by cross-species comparisons to macaques, indicated that CTCF and TF binding likelihood predicts the strength and direction of the allelic methylation asymmetry. These results show that hap-ASM is highly tissue specific; an important trans-acting regulator of genomic imprinting is regulated by this phenomenon; and variation in CTCF and TF binding sites is an underlying mechanism, and maps of hap-ASM and mQTLs reveal regulatory sequences underlying supra- and sub-threshold GWAS peaks in immunological and neurological disorders.},

Limited labeling or testing information is available to evaluate products as exposure sources., Objectives: We analytically quantified endocrine disruptors and asthma-related chemicals in a range of cosmetics, personal care products, cleaners, sunscreens, and vinyl products. We also evaluated whether product labels provide information that can be used to select products without these chemicals., Methods: We selected 213 commercial products representing 50 product types. We tested 42 composited samples of high-market-share products, and we tested 43 alternative products identified using criteria expected to minimize target compounds. Analytes included parabens, phthalates, bisphenol A (BPA), triclosan, ethanolamines, alkylphenols, fragrances, glycol ethers, cyclosiloxanes, and ultraviolet (UV) filters., Results: We detected 55 compounds, indicating a wide range of exposures from common products. Vinyl products contained {$>$} 10\% bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and could be an important source of DEHP in homes. In other products, the highest concentrations and numbers of detects were in the fragranced products (e.g., perfume, air fresheners, and dryer sheets) and in sunscreens. Some products that did not contain the well-known endocrine-disrupting phthalates contained other less-studied phthalates (dicyclohexyl phthalate, diisononyl phthalate, and di-n-propyl phthalate; also endocrine-disrupting compounds), suggesting a substitution. Many detected chemicals were not listed on product labels., Conclusions: Common products contain complex mixtures of EDCs and asthma-related compounds. Toxicological studies of these mixtures are needed to understand their biological activity. Regarding epidemiology, our findings raise concern about potential confounding from co-occurring chemicals and misclassification due to variability in product composition. Consumers should be able to avoid some target chemicals\textemdash synthetic fragrances, BPA, and regulated active ingredients\textemdash using purchasing criteria. More complete product labeling would enable consumers to avoid the rest of the target chemicals.},

We also evaluated the implication of findings to relevant methylation pathways and the potential contribution of Cd exposure from smoking to explain the association between smoking and site-specific DNAm.Methods:We conducted an epigenome-wide association study of urine Cd and self-reported smoking (current and former vs. never, and cumulative smoking dose) with blood DNAm in 790,026 CpGs (methylation sites) measured with the Illumina Infinium Human MethylationEPIC (Illumina Inc.) platform in 2,325 adults 45\textendash 74 years of age who participated in the Strong Heart Study in 1989\textendash 1991. In a mediation analysis, we estimated the amount of change in DNAm associated with smoking that can be independently attributed to increases in urine Cd concentrations from smoking. We also conducted enrichment analyses and in silico protein\textendash protein interaction networks to explore the biological relevance of the findings.Results:At a false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected level of 0.05, we found 6 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) for Cd; 288 and 17, respectively, for current and former smoking status; and 77 for cigarette pack-years. Enrichment analyses of these DMPs displayed enrichment of 58 and 6 Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes gene sets, respectively, including biological pathways for cancer and cardiovascular disease. In in silico protein-to-protein networks, we observed key proteins in DNAm pathways directly and indirectly connected to Cd- and smoking-DMPs. Among DMPs that were significant for both Cd and current smoking (annotated to PRSS23, AHRR, F2RL3, RARA, and 2q37.1), we found statistically significant contributions of Cd to smoking-related DNAm.Conclusions:Beyond replicating well-known smoking epigenetic signatures, we found novel DMPs related to smoking. Moreover, increases in smoking-related Cd exposure were associated with differential DNAm. Our integrative analysis supports a biological link for Cd and smoking-associated health effects, including the possibility that Cd is partly responsible for smoking toxicity through epigenetic changes.  https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6345},

Some current research on the fetal control growth has been focused on the study of genes that display imprinted expression in utero. Four imprinted genes, two paternally expressed (IGF2 and PEG10) and two maternally expressed (PHLDA2 and CDKN1C), are well known to play a role in fetal growth and placental development. Pregnancy loss in the general reproductive population is a very common occurrence and other genetic causes beyond chromosomal abnormalities could be involved in spontaneous miscarriages or fetal deaths, such as alteration of expression in imprinted genes particularly those related to fetal or placental growth. Quantitative Real Time PCR was performed to evaluate gene expressions patterns of the four mentioned genes in spontaneous miscarriages or fetal deaths from 38 women. Expression levels of PHLDA2 gene were upregulated in the first trimester pregnancy cases and all four imprinted genes studied were upregulated in the second trimester of pregnancy cases comparing with controls. In third trimester PEG10 was downregulated in fetal samples group. This is the first study presenting data from human imprinted genes expression in spontaneous miscarriages or fetal deaths cases from the three trimesters of pregnancy.},

The BeadArray technology from Illumina makes its preprocessing and quality control different from other microarray technologies. Unfortunately, most other analyses have not taken advantage of the unique properties of the BeadArray system, and have just incorporated preprocessing methods originally designed for Affymetrix microarrays. lumi is a Bioconductor package especially designed to process the Illumina microarray data. It includes data input, quality control, variance stabilization, normalization and gene annotation portions. In specific, the lumi package includes a variance-stabilizing transformation (VST) algorithm that takes advantage of the technical replicates available on every Illumina microarray. Different normalization method options and multiple quality control plots are provided in the package. To better annotate the Illumina data, a vendor independent nucleotide universal identifier (nuID) was devised to identify the probes of Illumina microarray. The nuID annotation packages and output of lumi processed results can be easily integrated with other Bioconductor packages to construct a statistical data analysis pipeline for Illumina data.},

Triclosan is widely used as an antibacterial agent and reported to transport across the placenta and affect embryonic development. Here, we used human embryonic stem cell- (hESC-) derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) to determine the effects of TCS exposure on cardiac development. After TCS treatment, the differentiation process was significantly blocked and spontaneous beating rates of CMs were also decreased. Transcriptome analysis showed the dysregulation of genes involved in cardiogenesis, including GATA4 and TNNT2. Additionally, DNA methylation was also altered by TCS exposure, especially in those regions with GATA motif enrichment. These alterations of transcriptome and DNA methylation were all associated with signaling pathways integral to heart development. Our findings indicate that TCS exposure might cause cardiomyocyte differentiation toxicity and provide the new insights into how environmental factors regulate DNA methylation and gene expressions during heart development.},

  abstract = {During pregnancy, fetal thyroid hormones (THs) are dependent on maternal placental transport and their physiological level is crucial for normal fetal neurodevelopment. Earlier research has shown that Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) disrupts thyroid function and THs homeostasis in pregnant women and fetuses, and affects placental THs transport. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The present study, therefore, aimed to systematically investigate the potential mechanisms of DEHP-induced disruption in the placental THs transport using two human placental trophoblastic cells, HTR-8/SVneo cells and JEG-3 cells. While the exposure of DEHP at the doses of 0\textendash 400 {$\mu$}M for 24 h did not affect cell viability, we found reduced consumption of T3 and T4 in the culture medium of HTR-8/Svneo cells treated with DEHP at 400 {$\mu$}M. DEHP treatment did not affect T3 uptake and the expression of monocarboxylate transporters 8 (MCT8) and organic anion transporters 1C1 (OATP1C1). However, DEHP significantly inhibited transthyretin (TTR) internalization, down-regulated TTR, deiodinase 2 (DIO2), and thyroid hormone receptors mRNA expression and protein levels, and up-regulated deiodinase 3 (DIO3) protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that DEHP acts on placental trophoblast cells, inhibits its TTR internalization, down-regulates TTR expression and affects the expression of DIO2, DIO3, and thyroid hormone receptor. These may be the mechanisms by which PAEs affects THs transport through placental.},

Microvascular hypoplasia of the terminal villi is a common pathology in severe Intra Uterine Growth Restriction (IUGR). We used novel methods to obtain placental micro-vascular endothelial cells (PlMEC) from preterm control placentas (n~=~3) and placentas from pregnancies with severe IUGR (n~=~6) with absent or reversed end-diastolic velocity in the umbilical artery. Distal placental villous tissue was collected to enrich for intermediate and terminal villi. Tissue was digested and PlMEC positively selected using tocosylated magnetic Dynabeads labeled with Human Endothelial Antigen lectin. The purity of the PlMEC (94~{$\pm~$}2 SD \%) was assessed by CD31 and vimentin immunocytochemistry. RNA was extracted from the PlMEC samples and subjected to Affymetrix microarray analysis (U133Plus2 array chips). Comparison of preterm and IUGR PlMEC gene expression profiles identified BTNL9 and NTRK2 transcripts to be upregulated and SAA1 and SLAMF1 transcripts to be downregulated in all 6 IUGR cases relative to preterm controls. A third downregulated gene GNAS was identified to be near significance. Changes were demonstrated to be significant at the mRNA level by Real Time PCR in the PlMEC samples. Changes in the IUGR endothelium were confirmed at the protein level by immunohistochemistry for the 3 with available antibodies. We used a tissue microarray constructed from an independent cohort of placental samples from severe IUGR (n~=~7), preeclamptic (n~=~7), preterm control (n~=~6) and term control (n~=~6) pregnancies. Results confirmed differential endothelial expression of BTNL9, NTRK2 and SLAMF1 in IUGR versus preterm and term samples. These studies are the first to characterize PlMEC gene expression profiles thus we have advanced our understanding of the molecular basis of placental micro-vascular pathophysiology in fetal growth restriction.},

Phthalates are not present in plastics by covalent bonds and thus can easily leach into the environment and enter the human body by dermal absorption, ingestion, or inhalation. Several in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that phthalates can act as endocrine disruptors and cause moderate reproductive and developmental toxicities. Furthermore, phthalates can pass through the placental barrier and affect the developing fetus. Thus, phthalates have ubiquitous presence in food and environment with potential adverse health effects in humans. This review focusses on studies conducted in the field of toxicogenomics of phthalates and discusses possible transgenerational and multigenerational effects caused by phthalate exposure during any point of the life-cycle.},

Two independent reviewers screened abstracts and extracted data. We included original studies reporting on the association between prenatal or childhood urinary phthalate metabolites, and cognitive and behavioral outcomes (e.g., IQ scores, BASC-2 scores or equivalent) in children 0\textendash 12 years of age. Results: Of 2804 abstracts screened, 11 original articles met our criteria for inclusion. Conclusions: A systematic review of the literature supports the contention that prenatal exposure phthalates is associated with adverse cognitive and behavioral outcomes in children, including lower IQ, and problems with attention, hyperactivity, and poorer social communication. Further research characterizing the associations between specific phthalate metabolites and children's neurodevelopmental outcomes is needed to support the development of mitigation strategies and enhance the development of appropriate health policy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Experimental and observational studies have reported biological consequences of phthalate exposure relevant to neurodevelopment. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to examine the association of prenatal phthalate exposure with behavior and executive functioning at 4-9 years of age. METHODS: The Mount Sinai Children's Environmental Health Study enrolled a multiethnic prenatal population in New York City between 1998 and 2002 (n = 404). Third-trimester maternal urines were collected and analyzed for phthalate metabolites. Children (n = 188, n = 365 visits) were assessed for cognitive and behavioral development between the ages of 4 and 9 years. RESULTS: In multivariate adjusted models, increased loge concentrations of low molecular weight (LMW) phthalate metabolites were associated with poorer scores on the aggression [beta = 1.24; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.15- 2.34], conduct problems (beta = 2.40; 95\% CI, 1.34-3.46), attention problems (beta = 1.29; 95\% CI, 0.16- 2.41), and depression (beta = 1.18; 95\% CI, 0.11-2.24) clinical scales; and externalizing problems (beta = 1.75; 95\% CI, 0.61-2.88) and behavioral symptom index (beta = 1.55; 95\% CI, 0.39-2.71) composite scales. Increased loge concentrations of LMW phthalates were also associated with poorer scores on the global executive composite index (beta = 1.23; 95\% CI, 0.09-2.36) and the emotional control scale (beta = 1.33; 95\% CI, 0.18- 2.49). CONCLUSION: Behavioral domains adversely associated with prenatal exposure to LMW phthalates in our study are commonly found to be affected in children clinically diagnosed with conduct or attention deficit hyperactivity disorders.},

OBJECTIVES: We undertook an investigation into whether prenatal exposure to phthalates was associated with clinically confirmed ADHD in a population-based nested case-control study of the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort (MoBa) between the years 2003 and 2008. METHODS: Phthalate metabolites were measured in maternal urine collected at midpregnancy. Cases of ADHD (n=297) were obtained through linkage between MoBa and the Norwegian National Patient Registry. A random sample of controls (n=553) from the MoBa population was obtained. RESULTS: In multivariable adjusted coexposure models, the sum of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate metabolites ({$\sum$}DEHP) was associated with a monotonically increasing risk of ADHD. Children of mothers in the highest quintile of {$\sum$}DEHP had almost three times the odds of an ADHD diagnosis as those in the lowest [OR=2.99 (95\% CI: 1.47, 5.49)]. When {$\sum$}DEHP was modeled as a log-linear (natural log) term, for each log-unit increase in exposure, the odds of ADHD increased by 47\% [OR=1.47 (95\% CI: 1.09, 1.94)]. We detected no significant modification by sex or mediation by prenatal maternal thyroid function or by preterm delivery. CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based case-control study of clinical ADHD, maternal urinary concentrations of DEHP were monotonically associated with increased risk of ADHD. Additional research is needed to evaluate potential mechanisms linking phthalates to ADHD. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2358.},

METHODS: Participants from the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas study, a birth cohort study, included 360 singletons with maternal serum measures of p,p'-DDT, o,p'-DDT, and p,p'-DDE. Psychomotor development and mental development were assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development at 6, 12, and 24 months. RESULTS: We found a approximately 2-point decrease in Psychomotor Developmental Index scores with each 10-fold increase in p,p'-DDT levels at 6 and 12 months (but not 24 months) and p,p'-DDE levels at 6 months only. We found no association with mental development at 6 months but a 2- to 3-point decrease in Mental Developmental Index scores for p,p'-DDT and o,p'-DDT at 12 and 24 months, corresponding to 7- to 10-point decreases across the exposure range. Even when mothers had substantial exposure, breastfeeding was usually associated positively with Bayley scale scores. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal exposure to DDT, and to a lesser extent DDE, was associated with neurodevelopmental delays during early childhood, although breastfeeding was found to be beneficial even among women with high levels of exposure. Countries considering the use of DDT should weigh its benefit in eradicating malaria against the negative associations found in this first report on DDT and human neurodevelopment.},

Animal studies suggest that even moderate doses are neurodevelopmental toxicants, but there are few studies in humans. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the relationship of prenatal and child OP urinary metabolite levels with children's neurodevelopment. METHODS: Participating children were from a longitudinal birth cohort of primarily Latino farm-worker families in California. We measured six nonspecific dialkylphosphate (DAP) metabolites in maternal and child urine as well as metabolites specific to malathion (MDA) and chlorpyrifos (TCPy) in maternal urine. We examined their association with children's performance at 6 (n = 396), 12 (n = 395), and 24 (n = 372) months of age on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development [Mental Development (MDI) and Psychomotor Development (PDI) Indices] and mother's report on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (n = 356). RESULTS: Generally, pregnancy DAP levels were negatively associated with MDI, but child measures were positively associated. At 24 months of age, these associations reached statistical significance [per 10-fold increase in prenatal DAPs: beta = -3.5 points; 95\% confidence interval (CI), -6.6 to -0.5; child DAPs: beta = 2.4 points; 95\% CI, 0.5 to 4.2]. Neither prenatal nor child DAPs were associated with PDI or CBCL attention problems, but both prenatal and postnatal DAPs were associated with risk of pervasive developmental disorder [per 10-fold increase in prenatal DAPs: odds ratio (OR) = 2.3, p = 0.05; child DAPs OR = 1.7, p = 0.04]. MDA and TCPy were not associated with any outcome. CONCLUSIONS: We report adverse associations of prenatal DAPs with mental development and pervasive developmental problems at 24 months of age. Results should be interpreted with caution given the observed positive relationship with postnatal DAPs.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) detoxifies oxon derivatives of some organophosphate (OP) pesticides, and its genetic polymorphisms influence enzyme activity and quantity. We previously reported that maternal urinary concentrations of dialkyl phosphate (DAP) metabolites, a marker of OP pesticide exposure, were related to poorer mental development and maternally reported symptoms consistent with pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) in 2-year-olds participating in the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas (CHAMACOS) study. OBJECTIVE: We determined whether PON1 genotypes and enzyme measurements were associated with child neurobehavioral development and whether PON1 modified the association of in utero exposure to OPs (as assessed by maternal DAPs) and neurobehavior. METHODS: We measured DAP concentrations in maternal urine during pregnancy, PON1{$_{192}$} and PON1{$_{-108}$} genotypes in mothers and children, and arylesterase (ARYase) and paraoxonase (POase) in maternal, cord, and 2-year-olds' blood. We assessed 353 2-year-olds on the Mental Development Index (MDI) and Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development and queried their mothers on the Child Behavior Checklist to obtain a score for PDD. RESULTS: Children with the PON1(-108T) allele had poorer MDI scores and somewhat poorer PDI scores. Children were less likely to display PDD when they or their mothers had higher ARYase activity and when their mothers had higher POase activity. The association between DAPs and MDI scores was strongest in children with PON1(-108T) allele, but this and other interactions between DAPs and PON1 polymorphisms or enzymes were not significant. CONCLUSION: PON1 was associated with child neurobehavioral development, but additional research is needed to confirm whether it modifies the relation with in utero OP exposure.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cadmium (Cd) is a ubiquitous environmental toxicant that can accumulate in the placenta during pregnancy, where it may impair placental function and affect fetal development. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate Cd-associated variations in placental DNA methylation (DNAM) and associations with gene expression; we also aimed to identify novel pathways involved in Cd-associated reproductive toxicity. METHODS: Using placental DNAM and Cd concentrations in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study (NHBCS, n = 343) and the Rhode Island Child Health Study (RICHS, n = 141), we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) between Cd and DNAM, adjusting for tissue heterogeneity using a reference-free method. Cohort-specific results were aggregated via inverse variance weighted fixed effects meta-analysis, and variably methylated CpGs were associated with gene expression. We then performed functional enrichment analysis and tests for associations between gene expression and birth size metrics. RESULTS: We identified 17 Cd-associated differentially methylated CpG sites with meta-analysis p-values {$<$}1 \texttimes{} 10-5, two of which were within a 5\% false discovery rate (FDR). DNAM levels at 9 of the 17 loci were associated with increased expression of 6 genes (5\% FDR): TNFAIP2, EXOC3L4, GAS7, SREBF1, ACOT7, and RORA. Higher placental expression of TNFAIP2 and ACOT7 and lower expression of RORA were associated with lower birth weight z-scores (p-values {$<$}0:05). CONCLUSION: Cd-associated differential DNAM and corresponding DNAM-expression associations were observed at loci involved in inflammatory signaling and cell growth. The expression levels of genes involved in inflammatory signaling (TNFAIP2, ACOT7, and RORA) were also associated with birth weight, suggesting a role for inflammatory processes in Cd-associated reproductive toxicity. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2192},

  abstract = {Background: Prenatal cadmium (Cd) exposure has been recognized to restrict growth, and male and female fetuses may have differential susceptibility to the developmental toxicity of Cd. Imprinted genes, which exhibit monoallelic expression based on parent of origin, are highly expressed in placental tissues. The function of these genes is particularly critical to fetal growth and development, and some are expressed in sex-specific patterns. Objectives: We aimed to examine whether prenatal Cd associates with the expression of imprinted placental genes, overall or in fetal sex-specific patterns, across two independent epidemiologic studies. Methods: We tested for Cd\textendash sex interactions in association with gene expression, then regressed the placental expression levels of 74 putative imprinted genes on placental log-Cd concentrations while adjusting for maternal age, sex, smoking history, and educational attainment. These models were performed within study- and sex-specific strata in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study (NHBCS; n=326) and the Rhode Island Child Health Study (RICHS; n=211). We then used fixed-effects models to estimate the sex-specific and overall associations across strata and then examine heterogeneity in the associations by fetal sex. Results: We observed that higher Cd concentrations were associated with higher expression of distal-less homeobox 5 (DLX5) (p=0.000025), and lower expression of h19 imprinted maternally expressed transcript (H19) (p=0.00027) and necdin, MAGE family member (NDN) (p=0.00064) across study and sex-specific strata, while three other genes [carboxypeptidase A4 (CPA4), growth factor receptor bound protein 10 (GRB10), and integrin-linked kinase (ILK)] were significantly associated with Cd concentrations, but only among female placenta (pinteraction{$<$}0.05). Additionally, the expression of DLX5, H19, and NDN, the most statistically significant Cd-associated genes, were also associated with standardized birth weight z-scores. Discussion: The differential regulation of a set of imprinted genes, particularly DLX5, H19 and NDN, in association with prenatal Cd exposure may be involved in overall developmental toxicity, and some imprinted genes may respond to Cd exposure in a manner that is specific to infant gender. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4264},

OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence from studies investigating the association between paracetamol use in pregnancy and childhood asthma. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken of studies reporting the association between paracetamol use in pregnancy and subsequent asthma in childhood. The primary outcome variable was wheeze in the last 12 months. For tabulated raw data, not adjusted for confounders, random effects odds ratios (OR) were pooled by the inverse variance weighted method. RESULTS: There were six studies identified that were included in the meta-analysis. The age of children studied ranged from 30 to 84 months. The pooled random effects OR for the risk of current wheeze in the children of women who were exposed to any paracetamol during any stage of pregnancy was 1.21 (95\% confidence interval 1.02-1.44). Features of the studies variably included an association with paracetamol use during all trimesters of pregnancy and an association with persistent asthma, severe asthma, and with atopy. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The use of paracetamol during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma. More research is urgently required to determine the impact of paracetamol during pregnancy on the risk of wheezing in offspring so that appropriate public health recommendations can be made.},

We applied multiexposure linear mixed-effects regressions with participant-level random intercept to identify significant Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) sites and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in relation to 1-y average aircraft, railway, and road traffic day-evening-night noise (Lden); nitrogen dioxide (NO2); and particulate matter (PM) with aerodynamic diameter {$<$} 2:5 lm (PM2:5). We performed candidate (CpG-based; cross-systemic phenotypes, combined into ``allostatic load'') and agnostic (DMR-based) pathway enrichment tests, and replicated previously reported air pollution EWAS signals. RESULTS: We found no statistically significant CpGs at false discovery rate {$<$} 0:05. However, 14, 48, 183, 8, and 71 DMRs independently associated with aircraft, railway, and road traffic Lden; NO2; and PM2:5, respectively, with minimally overlapping signals. Transportation Lden and air pollutants tendentially associated with decreased and increased methylation, respectively. We observed significant enrichment of candidate DNA methylation related to C-reactive protein and body mass index (aircraft, road traffic Lden, and PM2:5), renal function and ``allostatic load'' (all exposures). Agnostic functional networks related to cellular immunity, gene expression, cell growth/proliferation, cardiovascular, auditory, embryonic, and neurological systems development were enriched. We replicated increased methylation in cg08500171 (NO2) and decreased methylation in cg17629796 (PM2:5). CONCLUSIONS: Mutually independent DNA methylation was associated with source-specific transportation noise and air pollution exposures, with distinct and shared enrichments for pathways related to inflammation, cellular development, and immune responses. These findings contribute in clarifying the pathways linking these exposures and age-related diseases but need further confirmation in the context of mediation analyses. https://doi.org/ 10.1289/EHP6174},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prior research reports inverse associations between maternal prenatal urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations and mental and motor development in preschoolers. No study evaluated whether these associations persist into school age. METHODS: In a follow up of 328 inner-city mothers and their children, we measured prenatal urinary metabolites of di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), butylbenzyl phthalate (BBzP), di-isobutyl phthalate (DiBP), di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate and diethyl phthalate in late pregnancy. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th edition was administered at child age 7 years and evaluates four areas of cognitive function associated with overall intelligence quotient (IQ). RESULTS: Child full-scale IQ was inversely associated with prenatal urinary metabolite concentrations of DnBP and DiBP: b{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}-2.69 (95\% confidence interval [CI]{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}-4.33, -1.05) and b{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}-2.69 (95\% CI{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}-4.22, -1.16) per log unit increase. Among children of mothers with the highest versus lowest quartile DnBP and DiBP metabolite concentrations, IQ was 6.7 (95\% CI{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}1.9, 11.4) and 7.6 (95\% CI{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}3.2, 12.1) points lower, respectively. Associations were unchanged after control for cognition at age 3 years. Significant inverse associations were also seen between maternal prenatal metabolite concentrations of DnBP and DiBP and child processing speed, perceptual reasoning and working memory; DiBP and child verbal comprehension; and BBzP and child perceptual reasoning. CONCLUSION: Maternal prenatal urinary metabolite concentrations measured in late pregnancy of DnBP and DiBP are associated with deficits in children's intellectual development at age 7 years. Because phthalate exposures are ubiquitous and concentrations seen here within the range previously observed among general populations, results are of public health significance.},

  abstract = {There is increasing evidence that toxicant exposure can alter DNA methylation profile, one of the main epigenetic mechanisms, particularly during embryogenesis when DNA methylation patterns are being established. In order to investigate the effects of the antibacterial agent Triclosan on DNA methylation and its correlation with gene expression, zebrafish embryos were exposed during 7 days postfertilization (starting at maximum 8-cells stage) to 50 and 100 mg/l, two conditions for which increased sensitivity and acclimation have been respectively reported. Although global DNA methylation was not significantly affected, a total of 171 differentially methylated fragments were identified by Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing. The majority of these fragments were found between the two exposed groups, reflecting dose-dependant specific responses. Gene ontology analysis revealed that pathways involved in TGF-b signaling were enriched in larvae exposed to 50 mg/l, while de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis functions were overrepresented in fish exposed to 100 mg/l. In addition, gene expression analysis revealed a positive correlation between mRNA levels and DNA methylation patterns in introns, together with significant alterations of the transcription of genes involved in nervous system development, transcriptional factors and histone methyltransferases. Overall this work provides evidence that Triclosan alters DNA methylation in zebrafish exposed during embryogenesis as well as related genes expression and proposes concentration specific modes of action. Further studies will investigate the possible long-term consequences of these alterations, i.e. latent defects associated with developmental exposure and transgenerational effects, and the possible implications in terms of fitness and adaptation to environmental pollutants.},

There is a high risk of DBP exposure for human; it can easily migrate into the human bodies through food plastic packaging and be a potential hazard for human health. In this study the neurobehavioral effects of oral DBP for 14 days (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100 and 200~mg/kg) were investigated in mice, using open field, Y-maze, elevated plus maze, passive avoidance test, rotarod and grip strength test. The results showed that DBP could reduce total distance movement, impair memory function and induce anxiety in mice. Histological analysis (haematoxylin-eosin staining) also showed significant nuclei size reduction and condensation in dentate gyrus cells of the DBP treated mice. In conclusion oral DBP administration for 14 days may cause some neurobehavioral adverse effects in mice.},

Developmental BPA exposure in mice previously revealed widespread changes in the mouse liver methylome. Here, we undertake the first epigenome-wide analysis of the effect of BPA concentration on human fetal liver DNA methylation. Enzymatic enrichment of genomic DNA for high CG density and methylation followed by next-generation sequencing yielded data for positional methylation across the genome. Comparing three groups of BPA-exposed subjects (n\,=\,18; 6 per group), high (35.44\textendash 96.76\,ng/g), low (3.50 to 5.79\,ng/g), and non-detect ({$<$}0.83\,ng/g), revealed regions of altered methylation. Similar numbers of regions of altered methylations were detected in pairwise comparisons; however, their genomic locations were distinct between the non-detect and low or high BPA groups. In general, BPA levels were positively associated with methylation in CpG islands and negatively associated with methylation in CpG shores, shelves, and repetitive regions. DNA methylation at the SNORD imprinted cluster (15q11q13) illustrated both linear and non-monotonic associations with BPA levels. Integrated methylation and RNA-sequencing gene expression analysis revealed differential regulation of transcription at low BPA levels, as well as expression changes in RNA for ligand-binding proteins as BPA levels increase. BPA levels in human fetal liver tissue are associated with complex linear and non-monotonic as well as sequence-dependent alterations in DNA methylation. Future longitudinal studies are needed to link these changes with altered health risks.},

  abstract = {Developmental exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) has been shown to induce changes in DNA methylation in both mouse and human genic regions; however, the response in repetitive elements and transposons has not been explored. Here we present novel methodology to combine genomic DNA enrichment with RepeatMasker analysis on next-generation sequencing data to determine the effect of perinatal BPA exposure on repetitive DNA at the class, family, subfamily, and individual insertion level in both mouse and human samples. Mice were treated during gestation and lactation to BPA in chow at 0, 50, or 50,000 ng/g levels and total BPA was measured in stratified human fetal liver tissue samples as low (non-detect to 0.83 ng/g), medium (3.5 to 5.79 ng/g), or high (35.44 to 96.76 ng/g). Transposon methylation changes were evident in human classes, families, and subfamilies, with the medium group exhibiting hypomethylation compared to both high and low BPA groups. Mouse repeat classes, families, and subfamilies did not respond to BPA with significantly detectable differential DNA methylation. In human samples, 1251 individual transposon loci were detected as differentially methylated by BPA exposure, but only 19 were detected in mice. Of note, this approach recapitulated the discovery of a previously known mouse environmentally labile metastable epiallele, CabpIAP. Thus, by querying repetitive DNA in both mouse and humans, we report the first known transposons in humans that respond to perinatal BPA exposure.},

Recently published epidemiological studies suggested a possible association between paracetamol exposure in utero and attention-deficit\textendash hyperactivity disorder/hyperkinetic disorder (ADHD/HKD) or adverse development issues in children. However, the effects observed are in the weak to moderate range, and limitations in the studies' design prevent inference on a causal association with ADHD/HKD or child neurological development. In parallel, recent animal data showed that cognition and behaviour may be altered following exposure to therapeutic doses of paracetamol during early development. These effects may be mediated by interference of paracetamol with brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotransmitter systems (including serotonergic, dopaminergic, adrenergic, as well as the endogenous endocannabinoid systems), or cyclooxygenase-2. However, no firm conclusion can be made on the relevance of these observations to humans. We conclude that additional well-designed cohort studies are necessary to confirm or disprove the association. In the context of current knowledge, paracetamol is still to be considered safe in pregnancy and should remain the first-line treatment for pain and fever.},

We therefore investigated whether prenatal exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) or perfluorooctane sulfate (PFOS), two of the most prevalent PFCs, are associated with behavioral or coordination problems in early childhood. Methods We used data from the Danish National Birth Cohort, which enrolled mothers in early pregnancy, and we measured maternal blood levels of PFOA and PFOS using specimens drawn around 8 weeks of gestation. When the children reached 7 years of age, mothers completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ, n = 787) and the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire (DCDQ, n = 526) to assess behavioral health and motor coordination of their children. SDQ scores above the 90th percentile were a priori defined to identify behavioral problems and DCDQ scores below the 10th percentile were defined as a potential DCD. Results The median concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in maternal blood were 34.4 ng/mL [interquartile range (IQR), 26.6\textendash 44.5] and 5.4 ng/mL (IQR, 4.0\textendash 7.1), respectively, similar to distributions reported for populations without occupational exposure. We found no association between higher SDQ scores and maternal levels of PFOS or PFOA, nor did we see any statistically significant association with motor coordination disorders. Conclusion The findings suggest that background levels of PFOA and PFOS are not associated with behavioral and motor coordination problems in childhood. However, effects on other developmental end points, including cognitive, attentional, and clinical mental disorders not measured in this study, cannot be ruled out.},

They have been found to interfere with fetal growth in some animal models, but whether a similar effect is seen in humans is uncertain. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the association between plasma levels of PFOS and PFOA in pregnant women and their infants' birth weight and length of gestation. METHODS: We randomly selected 1,400 women and their infants from the Danish National Birth Cohort among those who completed all four computer-assisted telephone interviews, provided the first blood samples between gestational weeks 4 and 14, and who gave birth to a single live-born child without congenital malformation. PFOS and PFOA were measured by high performance liquid chromatography\textendash tandem mass spectrometer. RESULTS: PFOS and PFOA levels in maternal plasma were on average 35.3 and 5.6 ng/mL, respectively. Only PFOA levels were inversely associated with birth weight (adjusted {$\beta$} = \textendash 10.63 g; 95\% confidence interval, \textendash 20.79 to \textendash 0.47 g). Neither maternal PFOS nor PFOA levels were consistently associated with the risk for preterm birth or low birth weight. We observed no adverse effects for maternal PFOS or PFOA levels on small for gestational age. CONCLUSION: Our nationwide cohort data suggest an inverse association between maternal plasma PFOA levels and birth weight. Because of widespread exposure to these chemicals, our findings may be of potential public health concern.},

  abstract = {Background Maternal exposure to environmental phenols is common in pregnancy and has been linked to preterm birth, preeclampsia, and reduced fetal growth. One potential mechanism may be through increased maternal oxidative stress. Objective We examined the associations between a panel of 10 urinary phenols, including dichlorophenols, benzophenone-3, parabens, triclosan and triclocarban, and bisphenol-S, and two urinary oxidative stress biomarkers, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and 8-isoprostane. All exposure and outcome biomarkers were measured at 4 time points in pregnancy. Methods We used repeated measures models to examine the association between repeated exposure and outcome biomarkers. Additionally, we used adaptive elastic net (AENET) to identify non-null associations accounting for the correlation structure of exposures, both for phenols and urinary phthalate metabolites that were previously associated with the oxidative stress biomarkers in our study population. Results In adjusted repeated measures models, we observed that dichlorophenols, benzophenone-3, triclosan, and some parabens were associated with increases in both oxidative stress biomarkers. The greatest effect estimates were observed for 2,5-dichlorophenol; an interquartile range (IQR) increase in this compound was associated with a 15.2\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 11.0, 19.6) increase in 8-OHdG and a 16.7\% (95\% CI = 9.66, 24.2) increase in 8-isoprostane. Bisphenol-S detection was associated with a clear increase in 8-isoprostane (18.5\%, 95\% CI = 7.68, 30.5) but a more modest increase in 8-OHdG (6.18\%, 95\% CI = -0.27, 13.1). However, AENET models did not consistently select any of the phenols as predictors of 8-OHdG or 8-isoprostane when phthalate metabolites were included in the model. Conclusion Overall, urinary phenols were associated with increases in biomarkers of oxidative stress in pregnancy but either to a lesser extent, or due to correlation with, urinary phthalate metabolites.},

Recently, it has been replaced by Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip (EPIC) covering over 850,000 CpGs distributed genome-wide. Many consortia have now datasets coming from both arrays and aspire to analyze the two together. The placenta shows a high number of intermediate methylation levels and is often investigated for obstetric/birth outcomes, and potentially for long-term programming in offspring. We performed a systematic comparison between the two arrays using 108 duplicate placental samples from Gen3G birth cohort. We find that placenta shows a high per-sample correlation between the arrays, and higher median correlations at individual CpGs than those reported for blood. We identify 26,340 probes with absolute difference in per cent methylation {$>$}10\%. We conclude that EPIC and 450K placental data can be combined, and we provide two lists of CpGs that should be excluded to avoid misleading results.},

  abstract = {Objectives Famine exposure in utero can `programme' an individual towards type 2 diabetes and obesity in later life. We sought to identify, (1) whether Bangladeshis exposed to famine during developmental life are programmed towards diabetes and obesity, (2) whether this programming was specific to gestational or postnatal exposure windows and (3) whether epigenetic differences were associated with famine exposure. Design A historical cohort study was performed as part of a wider cross-sectional survey. Exposure to famine was defined through birth date and historical records and participants were selected according to: (A) exposure to famine in postnatal life, (B) exposure to famine during gestation and (C) unexposed. Setting Matlab, a rural area in the Chittagong division of Bangladesh. Participants Young adult men and women (n=190) recruited to a historical cohort study with a randomised subsample included in an epigenetic study (n=143). Outcome measures Primary outcome measures of weight, body mass index and oral glucose tolerance tests (0 and 120 min glucose). Secondary outcome measures included DNA methylation using genome-wide and targeted analysis of metastable epialleles sensitive to maternal nutrition. Results More young adults exposed to famine in gestation were underweight than those postnatally exposed or unexposed. In contrast, more young adults exposed to famine postnatally were overweight compared to those gestationally exposed or unexposed. Underweight adults exposed to famine in gestation in utero were hyperglycaemic following a glucose tolerance test, and those exposed postnatally had elevated fasting glucose, compared to those unexposed. Significant differences in DNA methylation at seven metastable epialleles (VTRNA2-1, PAX8, PRDM-9, near ZFP57, near BOLA, EXD3) known to vary with gestational famine exposure were identified. Conclusions Famine exposure in developmental life programmed Bangladeshi offspring towards diabetes and obesity in adulthood but gestational and postnatal windows of exposure had variable effects on phenotype. DNA methylation differences were replicated at previously identified metastable epialleles sensitive to periconceptual famine exposure.},

  abstract = {Pericentric heterochromatin (PCH) is a particular form of constitutive heterochromatin that is localized to both sides of centromeres and that forms silent compartments enriched in repressive marks. These genomic regions contain species-specific repetitive satellite DNA that differs in terms of nucleotide sequences and repeat lengths. In spite of this sequence diversity, PCH is involved in many biological phenomena that are conserved among species, including centromere function, the preservation of genome integrity, the suppression of spurious recombination during meiosis, and the organization of genomic silent compartments in the nucleus. PCH organization and maintenance of its repressive state is tightly regulated by a plethora of factors, including enzymes (e.g., DNA methyltransferases, histone deacetylases, and histone methyltransferases), DNA and histone methylation binding factors (e.g., MECP2 and HP1), chromatin remodeling proteins (e.g., ATRX and DAXX), and non-coding RNAs. This evidence helps us to understand how PCH organization is crucial for genome integrity. It then follows that alterations to the molecular signature of PCH might contribute to the onset of many genetic pathologies and to cancer progression. Here, we describe the most recent updates on the molecular mechanisms known to underlie PCH organization and function.},

There have been numerous diseases, exposures and lifestyle factors investigated with EWAS, with several significant associations now identified.

  abstract = {Toll-like receptor (TLR)3 is a key component of the innate immune response to viral infection. The present study firstly examined whether sex differences exist in TLR3-induced inflammatory, endocrine, and sickness responses. The data revealed that TLR3-induced expression of interferon- or NFkB-inducible genes (IFN-{$\alpha$}/{$\beta$}, IP-10, or TNF-{$\alpha$}), either peripherally (spleen) or centrally (hypothalamus), did not differ between male and female rats, with the exception of TLR3-induced IFN-{$\alpha$} expression in the spleen of female, but not male, rats 8 hr post TLR3 activation. Furthermore, TLR3 activation increased plasma corticosterone levels, induced fever, and reduced locomotor activity and body weight - effects independent of sex. Thus, the acute-phase inflammatory, endocrine, and sickness responses to TLR3 activation exhibit minimal sex-related differences. A further aim of this study was to examine whether enhancing endocannabinoid tone - namely, 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) or N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA), exhibited similar effects on TLR3-induced inflammatory responses in male versus female rats. Systemic administration of the monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) inhibitor MJN110 and subsequent increases in 2-AG levels did not alter the TLR3-induced increase in IP-10, IRF7, or TNF-{$\alpha$} expression in the spleen or the hypothalamus of male or female rats. In contrast, the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor URB597 increased levels of AEA and related N-acylethanolamines, an effect associated with the attenuation of TLR3-induced inflammatory responses in the hypothalamus, but not the spleen, of male and female rats. These data support a role for FAAH, but not MAGL, substrates in the modulation of TLR3-induced neuroinflammatory responses, effects independent of sex.},

  abstract = {Pesticides are commonly used in tropical regions such as the Caribbean for both household and agricultural purposes. Of particular concern is exposure during pregnancy, as these compounds can cross the placental barrier and interfere with fetal development. The objective of this study was to evaluate exposure of pregnant women residing in 10 Caribbean countries to the following commonly used classes of pesticides in the Caribbean: organophosphates (OPs), carbamates, phenoxy acids, and chlorophenols. Out of 438 urine samples collected, 15 samples were randomly selected from each Caribbean country giving a total of 150 samples. Samples were analyzed for the following metabolites: six OP dialkylphosphate metabolites [dimethylphosphate (DMP), dimethylthiophosphate (DMTP), dimethyldithiophosphate (DMDTP), diethylphosphate (DEP), diethylthiophosphate (DETP) and diethyldithiophosphate (DEDTP)]; two carbamate metabolites [2-isopropoxyphenol (2-IPP) and carbofuranphenol]; one phenoxy acid 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D); and five chlorophenols [2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP), 2,5-dichlorophenol (2,5-DCP), 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (TCP), 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP), and pentachlorophenol (PCP)]. OP metabolites were consistently detected in {$\geq$}60\% of the samples from Antigua and Barbuda, Bermuda, and Jamaica. Of the carbamate metabolites, 2-IPP was detected in seven of the 10 Caribbean countries with a detection frequency around 30\%, whereas carbofuranphenol was detected in only one sample. The detection frequency for the phenoxy acid 2,4-D ranged from 20\% in Grenada to a maximum of 67\% in Belize. Evidence of exposure to chlorophenol pesticides was also established with 2,4-DCP by geometric means ranging from 0.52 {$\mu$}g L(-1) in St Lucia to a maximum of 1.68 {$\mu$}g L(-1) in Bermuda. Several extreme concentrations of 2,5-DCP were detected in four Caribbean countries-Belize (1100 {$\mu$}g L(-1)), Bermuda (870 {$\mu$}g L(-1)), Jamaica (1300 {$\mu$}g L(-1)), and St Kitts and Nevis (1400 {$\mu$}g L(-1)). 2,4,5-TCP, 2,4,6-TCP, and pentachlorophenol were rarely detected. This biomonitoring study underscores the need for Caribbean public health authorities to encourage their populations, and in particular pregnant women, to become more aware of the potential routes of exposure to pesticides and to utilize these chemicals more cautiously given the possible adverse effects such exposures can have on their unborn children and infants.},

  abstract = {Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have focused primarily on DNA methylation as a chemically stable and functional epigenetic modification. However, the stability and accuracy of the measurement of methylation in different tissues and extraction types is still being actively studied, and the longitudinal stability of DNA methylation in commonly studied peripheral tissues is of great interest. Here, we used data from two studies, three tissue types, and multiple time points to assess the stability of DNA methylation measured with the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. Redundancy analysis enabled visual assessment of agreement of replicate samples overall and showed good agreement after removing effects of tissue type, age, and sex. At the probe level, analysis of variance contrasts separating technical and biological replicates clearly showed better agreement between technical replicates versus longitudinal samples, and suggested increased stability for buccal cells versus blood or blood spots. Intraclass correlations (ICCs) demonstrated that inter-individual variability is of similar magnitude to within-sample variability at many probes; however, as inter-individual variability increased, so did ICC. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate decreasing agreement in methylation levels with time, despite a maximal sampling interval of only 576 days. Finally, at 6 popular candidate genes, there was a large range of stability across probes.

  abstract = {Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are chemicals with potential neurotoxic effects although the current evidence is still limited. This study investigated the association between perinatal exposure to perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and neuropsychological development assessed at 6, 12 and 24 months. We measured PFOS and PFOA in breast milk samples collected one month after delivery by mothers of children participating in the HUMIS study (Norway). Cognitive and psychomotor development was measured at 6 and at 24 months using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-II). Behavioral development was assessed using the infant-toddler symptom checklist (ITSC) at 12 and at 24 months. Weighted logistic regression and weighted negative binomial regression models were applied to analyze the associations between PFASs and ASQ-II and ITSC, respectively. The median concentration of PFOS was 110 ng/L, while the median for PFOA was 40 ng/L. We did not detect an increased risk of having an abnormal score in ASQ-II at 6 months or 24 months. Moreover, no consistent increase in behavioral problems assessed at 12 and 24 months by ITSC questionnaire was detected. We observed no association between perinatal PFOS and PFOA exposure and early neuropsychological development. Further longitudinal studies are needed to confirm the effects of these compounds on neuropsychological development in older children.},

  abstract = {Background: There is insufficient epidemiological evidence for deciding whether prenatal exposure to the current low-levels of metals in developed countries may affect neuropsychological function in early childhood. Objectives: Our goal was to evaluate potential neurotoxic effects of prenatal exposure to seven metals (cobalt, copper, arsenic, cadmium, antimony, thallium and lead), during the 1st and 3rd trimester of pregnancy, on child neuropsychological development at 4 years of age. Materials and methods: This study was based on a population-based birth cohort established in Sabadell (Catalonia, Spain) as part of the INMA [Environment and Childhood] Project. Metals were measured in 485 urine samples collected from mothers during the 1st and 3rd trimester of pregnancy. We assessed the neuropsychological development of 553 4-year-olds with the McCarthy Scales of Childrens' Abilitites (MSCA), together with their ADHD symptomatology, using the ADHD-DSM-IV criteria. A total of 385 children were included in the present study. Results: We found no statistically significant associations between metals and general cognitive scale or executive function of the MSCA. We found negative coefficients for the exposure to cadmium 1st trimester, cadmium 3rd trimester and lead 3rd trimester on the general cognitive score of MSCA, although these results were not significant. We did not find any association between prenatal exposure to metals and ADHD symptomatology at the age of 4 years. Conclusions: Our results do not suggest that prenatal exposure to current low-levels of metals impairs children's cognitive development during preschool years.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the association between postnatal exposure to multiple persistent organic pollutants (POPs) measured in breast milk samples and early behavioral problems using statistical methods to deal with correlated exposure data. METHODS: We used data from the Norwegian HUMIS study. We measured concentrations of 24 different POPs in human milk from 612 mothers (median collection time: 32 days after delivery), including 13 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) congeners, 6 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) congeners and five organochlorine compounds. We assessed child behavioral problems at 12 and 24 months using the infant toddler symptom checklist (ITSC). Higher score in ITSC corresponds to more behavioral problems. First we performed principal component analysis (PCA). Then two variable selection methods, elastic net (ENET) and Bayesian model averaging (BMA), were applied to select any toxicants associated with behavioral problems. Finally, the effect size of the selected toxicants was estimated using multivariate linear regression analyses. RESULTS: p,p'-DDT was associated with behavioral problems at 12 months in all the applied models. Specifically, the principal component composed of organochlorine pesticides was significantly associated with behavioral problems and both ENET and BMA identified p,p'-DDT as associated with behavioral problems. Using a multiple linear regression model an interquartile increase in p,p'-DDT was associated with a 0.62 unit increase in ITSC score (95\% CI 0.45, 0.79) at 12 months, corresponding to more behavioral problems. The association was modified by maternal education: the effect of p,p'-DDT was strongest in women with lower education ({$\beta$}=0.59; 95\%CI: 0.38, 0.81) compared to the mother with higher education ({$\beta$}=0.14; 95\%CI: -0.05, 0.34) (p-value for interaction=0.089). At 24 months, neither selection method consistently identified any toxicant associated with behavioral problems. CONCLUSION: Within a mixture of 24 toxicants measured in breast milk, p,p'-DDT was the single toxicant associated with behavioral problems at 12 months using different methods for handling numerous correlated exposures.},

We classified children as having ADHD symptoms within the borderline/clinical range and within the clinical range using validated cutoffs. We combined all adjusted area-specific effect estimates using random-effects meta-analysis and multiple imputations and applied inverse probability-weighting methods to correct for loss to follow-up. Results: We classified a total of 2,801 children as having ADHD symptoms within the borderline/clinical range, and 1,590 within the clinical range. Exposure to air pollution during pregnancy was not associated with a higher odds of ADHD symptoms within the borderline/clinical range (e.g., adjusted odds ratio [OR] for ADHD symptoms of 0.95, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.89, 1.01 per 10 \textmu g/m3 increase in NO2 and 0.98, 95\% CI = 0.80, 1.19 per 5 \textmu g/ m3 increase in PM2.5).

In addition, these versatile proteins also regulate cell differentiation, cell growth and apoptosis in several cell types, and when mutated or disregulated significantly contribute to susceptibility to and progression of several cancers. IRF-1 is the most versatile member of the family, not essential for IFN gene expression and implicated in a variety of cellular functions spanning from the development and function of various immune cells to tumor suppression activity. IRF-3, IRF-7 and Irf-9 are more specifically involved in IFN induction and antiviral responses while IRF-5 is the regulator of inflammatory cytokines expression downstream pattern recognition receptors and IRF-6 is implicated in epithelial differentiation. IRF-8 as IRF-1 is considered a tumor suppressor gene, while IRF-2 and IRF-4 have generally oncogenic activity.},

The existence of a calibration substudy, where accurate and crude measurement methods are related by a second regression analysis, is assumed. The cost of measurement error in multivariate analyses is loss of statistical power. In this paper, calibration data from California Seventh-day Adventists are used to simulate study populations and new calibration studies. Applying regression calibration logistic analyses, the authors estimate power for pairs of nutritional variables. The results demonstrate substantial loss of power if variables measured with error are strongly correlated. Biases in estimated effects in cases where regression calibration is not performed can be large and are corrected by regression calibration. When the true coefficient has zero value, the corresponding coefficient in a crude analysis will usually have a nonzero expected value. Then type I error probabilities are not nominal, and the erroneous appearance of statistical significance can readily occur, particularly in large studies. Major determinants of power with use of regression calibration are collinearity between the variables measured with error and the size of correlations between crude and corresponding true variables. Where there is important collinearity, useful gains in power accrue with calibration study size up to 1,000 subjects.},

  abstract = {Developmental exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) and other phenolic endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may affect child neurodevelopment, but data on the effects of prenatal exposure to phenols on cognitive function remain sparse. Our aim was to examine the association of placental concentrations of several phenolic EDCs, including BPA, parabens (PBs), and benzophenones (BzPs), with cognitive development in preschool children from the Environment and Childhood (INMA) Project in Spain. Concentrations of BPA, four PBs (methylparaben [MePB], ethylparaben [EtPB], propylparaben [PrPB], and butylparaben [BuPB]), and six BzPs (BzP-1, BzP-2, BzP-3, BzP-6, BzP-8, and 4-hydroxybenzophenone [4-OH-BzP]) were measured in 490 placenta samples randomly selected from five INMA cohorts collected between 2000 and 2008. Neuropsychological assessment of cognitive and motor function was performed with the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities (MSCA) at the age of 4\textendash 5 years. Associations were assessed in a sub-sample of 191 mother-child pairs using linear and logistic regression models adjusted for confounding factors. PB compounds were detected in more than 71\% of placentas, BPA in 62\%, 4-OH-BzP in 50\%, and the remaining BzPs in {$<$}9\% of the samples. Because of the low detection frequency of BzP compounds, only 4-OH-BzP was included in the exposure-outcome analyses. After adjustment for confounders, BPA was associated with greater odds of scoring lower (below the 20th percentile) in the verbal (third vs. first exposure tertile: odds ratio [OR]~=~2.78, 95\% confidence interval [CI]~=~1.00; 5.81, p-trend~=~0.05) and gross motor (detected vs. undetected: OR~=~1.75, 95\%CI~=~1.06; 9.29) areas, and these associations were only significant for boys. Regarding PB compounds, PrPB was associated with lower scores in memory (detected vs. undetected: {$\beta~$}=~-4.96, 95\%CI~=~-9.54; -0.31), span memory (OR~=~2.50, 95\%CI~=~0.95; 6.92 and 2.71, 95\%CI~=~0.97; 6.64, respectively for second and third tertiles, p-trend~=~0.03), and motor function ({$\beta~$}=~-5.15, 95\%CI~=~-9.26; -0.01 for third vs. first exposure tertile, p-trend~=~0.04). EtPB and total PBs concentrations in the second tertile were also associated with poorer visual function of posterior cortex and worse quantitative performance, respectively, but linear trends were not statistically significant. The associations of BPA and PrPB with poorer verbal, memory, and motor skills are novel observations that warrant further attention. Larger prospective studies are required to confirm whether prenatal exposure to BPA and other phenolic EDCs is associated with impaired cognitive development.},

  abstract = {Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurobehavioral disorder affecting 5\% to 10\% of children. Although considered to be a highly familial disorder, ADHD heritability estimates of 60\% to 80\% highlight the considerable role that environmental factors may still play in disorder susceptibility. Proposed ADHD environmental risk factors include prenatal substance exposures, heavy metal and chemical exposures, nutritional factors, and lifestyle/psychosocial factors. This paper reviews the literature published in 2010 investigating the association between environmental risk factors and ADHD or related symptomatology. Sources of risk factor exposure and the proposed mechanism by which each exposure is linked to ADHD-related neurobehavioral changes are also reported. Methodologic limitations of the current literature are discussed, and guidelines for future study are proposed.

  abstract = {As a field of study, genomic imprinting has grown rapidly in the last 20 years, with a growing figure of around 100 imprinted genes known in the mouse and approximately 50 in the human. The imprinted expression of genes may be transient and highly tissue-specific, and there are potentially hundreds of other, as yet undiscovered, imprinted transcripts. The placenta is notable amongst mammalian organs for its high and prolific expression of imprinted genes. This review discusses the development of the human placenta and focuses on the function of imprinting in this organ. Imprinting is potentially a mechanism to balance parental resource allocation and it plays an important role in growth. The placenta, as the interface between mother and fetus, is central to prenatal growth control. The expression of genes subject to parental allelic expression bias has, over the years, been shown to be essential for the normal development and physiology of the placenta. In this review we also discuss the significance of genes that lack conservation of imprinting between mice and humans, genes whose imprinted expression is often placentalspecific. Finally, we illustrate the importance of imprinting in the postnatal human in terms of several human imprinting disorders, with consideration of the brain as a key organ for imprinted gene expression after birth.},

  abstract = {Numerous researches have been carried out to explain the relationship between the count data y and numbers of covariates x through a generalized linear model (GLM). This paper proposes a hierarchical Bayesian LASSO solution using six different prior models to the negative binomial regression. Latent variables Z have been introduced to simplify the GLM to a standard linear regression model. The proposed models regard two conjugate zero-mean Normal priors for the regression parameters and three independent priors for the variance: the Exponential, Inverse-Gamma and Scaled Inverse-{$\chi$}2 distributions. Different types of priors result in different amounts of shrinkage. A Metropolis-Hastings-within-Gibbs algorithm is used to compute the posterior distribution of the parameters of interest through a data augmentation process. Based on the posterior samples, an original Double Likelihood Ratio Test (DLRT) statistic have been proposed to choose the most relevant covariates and shrink the insignificant coefficients to zero. Numerical experiments on a real-life data set prove that Bayesian LASSO methods achieved significantly better predictive accuracy and robustness than the classical maximum likelihood estimation and the standard Bayesian inference.},

  abstract = {Copper (Cu) is a vital mineral essential for many biological processes. The vast majority of all Cu in healthy humans is associated with enzyme prosthetic groups or bound to proteins. Cu homeostasis is tightly regulated through a complex system of Cu transporters and chaperone proteins. Excess or toxicity of Cu, which is associated with the pathogenesis of hepatic disorder, neurodegenerative changes and other disease conditions, can occur when Cu homeostasis is disrupted. The capacity to initiate oxidative damage is most commonly attributed to Cu-induced cellular toxicity. Recently, altered cellular events, including lipid metabolism, gene expression, alpha-synuclein aggregation, activation of acidic sphingomyelinase and release of ceramide, and temporal and spatial distribution of Cu in hepatocytes, as well as Cu-protein interaction in the nerve system, have been suggested to play a role in Cu toxicity. However, whether these changes are independent of, or secondary to, an altered cellular redox state of Cu remain to be elucidated.},

  abstract = {A major challenge in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) is to derive the multiple testing threshold when hypothesis tests are conducted using a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms. Permutation tests are considered the gold standard in multiple testing adjustment in genetic association studies. However, it is computationally intensive, especially for GWASs, and can be impractical if a large number of random shuffles are used to ensure accuracy. Many researchers have developed approximation algorithms to relieve the computing burden imposed by permutation. One particularly attractive alternative to permutation is to calculate the effective number of independent tests, Meff, which has been shown to be promising in genetic association studies. In this study, we compare recently developed Meff methods and validate them by the permutation test with 10,000 random shuffles using two real GWAS data sets: an Illumina 1M BeadChip and an Affymetrix GeneChip\textregistered{} Human Mapping 500K Array Set. Our results show that the simpleM method produces the best approximation of the permutation threshold, and it does so in the shortest amount of time. We also show that Meff is indeed valid on a genome-wide scale in these data sets based on statistical theory and significance tests. The significance thresholds derived can provide practical guidelines for other studies using similar population samples and genotyping platforms.},

  abstract = {Concerns over the adverse reproductive outcomes in human have been raised, more evidence including the underlying mechanism are required. Since extravillous trophoblast (EVT) invasion is an important physiological step during early development, the effects of mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), the bioactive metabolite of DEHP, on EVT invasion were investigated using Matrigel-coated transwell chambers and cell line HTR-8/SVneo. In the transwell-based invasive assay, MEHP exposure inhibited EVT invasion as judged by decreased invasion index. Further analysis showed that MEHP exposure significantly inhibited the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), which is an important positive regulator of EVT invasion. Meanwhile, the protein levels of tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), one key negative regulator of EVT invasion, were upregulated by MEHP treatment. Finally, inactivation of PPAR{$\gamma$} pathway by either PPAR{$\gamma$} inhibitors or PPAR{$\gamma$} shRNA knockdown rescued the MEHP-induced inhibited invasion of HTR-8/SVneo cells, which is accompanied by the recovery of inhibited MMP-9 expression. The present study provides the evidence that MEHP exposure inhibits trophoblast invasion via PPAR{$\gamma$} at concentrations comparable to those found in humans, which provides an insight in understanding the mechanisms of DEHP-associated early pregnancy loss.},

There is evidence that in utero or perinatal exposure to bisphenol-A (BPA) leads to impaired glucose metabolism during adulthood. However, how BPA exposure during pregnancy affects pancreatic {$\beta$}-cell growth and function in offspring during early life has not been explored. We exposed pregnant mice to either vehicle (control) or BPA (10 and 100 {$\mu$}g/kg{$\cdot$}d, BPA10 and BPA100) and examined offspring on postnatal days (P) P0, P21, P30, and P120. BPA10 and BPA100 mice presented lower birth weight than control and subsequently gained weight until day 30. At that age, concentration of plasma insulin, C-peptide, and leptin were increased in BPA-exposed animals in the nonfasting state. Insulin secretion and content were diminished in BPA10 and maintained in BPA100 compared with control. A global gene expression analysis indicated that genes related with cell division were increased in islets from BPA-treated animals. This was associated with an increase in pancreatic {$\beta$}-cell mass at P0, P21, and P30 together with increased {$\beta$}-cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis. On the contrary, at P120, BPA-treated animals presented either equal or decreased {$\beta$}-cell mass compared with control and altered fasting glucose levels. These data suggest that in utero exposure to environmentally relevant doses of BPA alters the expression of genes involved in {$\beta$}-cell growth regulation, incrementing {$\beta$}-cell mass/area, and {$\beta$}-cell proliferation during early life. An excess of insulin signaling during early life may contribute to impaired glucose tolerance during adulthood.},

No associations were observed between prenatal phthalate exposure and cognitive and psychomotor scores at the age of 1 year and at the age of 4 years, except for an association between MBzP and lower psychomotor scores (\textasciicaron{} = -1.49 [95\% confidence interval (CI) = -2.78, -0.21]). 4DEHP concentrations were associated with increased social competence scores at 4 years and with reduced ADHD symptoms at age 4 and 7 years. Increasing MEP concentrations were associated with a reduced risk of inattention symptoms at 4 years. No associations were observed for MBzP, MiBP or MnBP in relation to behavioral problems. This study, with multiple phthalate exposure measurements and measures of neuropsychological domains at different ages, suggest that prenatal phthalate exposure does not adversely affect children's cognitive, psychomotor or behavioral development.},

We have previously reported elevated levels of these compounds for a cohort of mothers and neonates. Objective We examined the relationship between human exposure to parabens and antimicrobial compounds and birth outcomes including birth weight, body length and head size, and gestational age at birth. Methods Maternal third trimester urinary and umbilical cord blood plasma concentrations of methylparaben (MePB), ethylparaben (EtPB), propylparaben (PrPB), butylparaben (BuPB), benzylparaben (BePB), triclosan (2,4,4{${'}$}-trichloro-2{${'}$}-hydroxydiphenyl ether or TCS) and triclocarban (1-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl) urea or TCC), were measured in 185 mothers and 34 paired singleton neonates in New York, 2007\textendash 2009. Results In regression models adjusting for confounders, adverse exposure-outcome associations observed included increased odds of PTB (BuPB), decreased gestational age at birth (BuPB and TCC) and birth weight (BuPB), decreased body length (PrPB) and protective effects on PTB (BePB) and LBW (3{${'}$}-Cl-TCC) (p{$<$}0.05). No associations were observed for MePB, EtPB, or TCS. Conclusions This study provides the first evidence of associations between antimicrobials and potential adverse birth outcomes in neonates.

The mechanism by which paracetamol may modulate the increased risk of developing ADHD is currently unknown. We have conducted an epigenome-wide association study (n = 384 cord blood samples) and investigated whether prenatal exposure to paracetamol is associated with DNA methylation in children diagnosed with ADHD. Results: Analyses identified significant differences in DNA methylation (n = 6211 CpGs) associated with prenatal exposure to paracetamol for more than 20 days in children diagnosed with ADHD compared to controls. In addition, these samples were differentially methylated compared to samples with ADHD exposed to paracetamol for less than 20 days (n = 2089 CpGs) and not exposed to paracetamol (n = 193 CpGs). Interestingly, several of the top genes ranked according to significance and effect size have been linked to ADHD, neural development, and neurotransmission. Gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment of pathways involved in oxidative stress, neurological processes, and the olfactory sensory system, which have previously been implicated in the etiology of ADHD. Conclusions: These initial findings suggest that in individuals susceptible to ADHD, prenatal long-term exposure to paracetamol is associated with DNA methylation differences compared to controls.},

Transient and mild thyroid hormone insufficiency in pregnancy is also associated with impaired neurodevelopment in the offspring (e.g., 3\textendash 4 IQ score loss in association with maternal free thyroxine in the lowest fifth percentile). While inadequate iodine intake remains the most common underlying cause of mild thyroid hormone insufficiency in vulnerable populations including pregnant women, other factors such as exposure to environmental contaminants have recently attracted increasing attention, in particular in interaction with iodine deficiency. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are natural and synthetic substances with ubiquitous exposure in children and adults including pregnant women. EDCs interfere, temporarily or permanently, with hormonal signaling pathways in the endocrine system by binding to hormone receptors and modifying gene expression. Other mechanisms involve alterations in production, metabolism, and transfer of hormones. Experimental studies have shown that exposures to EDCs affect various brain processes such as neurogenesis, neural differentiation and migration, as well as neural connectivity. Neuroimaging studies confirm brain morphological abnormalities (e.g., cortical thinning) consistent with neurodevelopmental impairments as a result of EDC exposures at standard use levels. In this review, we provide an overview of present findings from toxicological and human studies on the anti-thyroid effect of EDCs with a specific attention to fetal and early childhood exposure. This brief overview highlights the need for additional multidisciplinary studies with a focus on thyroid disruption as an underlying mechanism for developmental neurotoxicity of EDC, which can provide insight into modifiable risk factors of developmental delays in children.},

  abstract = {Background: We analyzed placental DNA methylation levels at repeated sequences (LINE1 elements) and all CCGG sites (the LUMA assay) to study the effect of modifiable clinical or laboratory procedures involved in in vitro fertilization. We included four potential modifiable factors: oxygen tension during embryo culture, fresh embryo transfer vs frozen embryo transfer, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) vs conventional insemination or day 3 embryo transfer vs day 5 embryo transfer. Results: Global methylation levels differed between placentas from natural conceptions compared to placentas conceived by IVF. Placentas from embryos cultured at 20\% oxygen showed significant differences in LINE1 methylation compared to in vivo conceptions, while those from embryos cultured at 5\% oxygen, did not have significant differences. In addition, placentas from fresh embryo transfer had significantly different LINE1 methylation compared to placentas from in vivo conceptions, while embryos resulting from frozen embryos were not significantly different from controls. On sex-stratified analysis, only males had significant methylation differences at LINE1 elements stratified for the modifiable factors. As expected, LINE1 methylation was significantly different between males and females in the control population. However, we did not observe sex-specific differences in the IVF group. We validated this sex-specific observation in an additional cohort and in opposite sex IVF twins. Conclusion: We show that two clinically modifiable factors (embryo culture in 5 vs 20\% oxygen tension and fresh vs frozen embryo transfer) are associated with global placental methylation differences. Interestingly, males appear more vulnerable to such treatment-related global changes in DNA methylation than do females.},

  abstract = {Background Rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes exhibit alterations in cardiac function, ventricular remodeling, and changes in cell signaling, which includes protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. Moderate consumption of ethanol has a beneficial effect on cardiovascular outcomes in the general population, an effect that has recently been found to extend to patients with diabetes mellitus. We studied the effect of low-dose ethanol consumption on cardiac function, geometry, and PKC isoforms in the rat with STZ-induced diabetes. Methods Four groups of rats were studied over 8 to 10 weeks: control, STZ-induced diabetes, 12\% (v/v) ethanol consumption, and STZ-induced diabetes plus 4\% (v/v) ethanol consumption. Invasive hemodynamic measurements were performed; myocardial tissue was obtained for analysis for total PKC and cytosolic and membrane protein content of PKC-{$\alpha$}, PKC-{$\delta$}, and PKC-{$\epsilon$}, and two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiograms were obtained. Results Compared with rats with diabetes alone, consumption of 4\% ethanol prevented the decrease in left ventricular dP/dt seen with diabetes alone, as well as the increase in left ventricular internal dimension. Up-regulation of PKC-{$\alpha$}, -{$\delta$}, and -{$\epsilon$} occurring in the diabetic animals was also prevented by ethanol consumption, whereas ethanol alone had no effect on PKC isoform pattern. Conclusions These data suggest that STZ-induced cardiac remodeling and dysfunction are associated with increases in PKC activity, particularly PKC-{$\alpha$}, -{$\delta$}, and -{$\epsilon$}, and that consumption of ethanol can prevent these changes.},

These associations have been extensively replicated in studies in different countries and are not the result of confounding variables. They extend across the normal range of birthweight and depend on lower birthweights in relation to the duration of gestation rather than the effects of premature birth. The associations are thought to be consequences of 'programming', whereby a stimulus or insult at a critical, sensitive period of early life has permanent effects on structure, physiology and metabolism. Programming of the fetus may result from adaptations invoked when the materno-placental nutrient supply fails to match the fetal nutrient demand. Although the influences that impair fetal development and programme adult cardiovascular disease remain to be defined, there are strong pointers to the importance of maternal body composition and dietary balance during pregnancy.},

  abstract = {Background The majority of epidemiological studies concerning possible adverse effects of paracetamol (acetaminophen) in pregnancy have been focussed on childhood asthma. Initial results of a robust association have been confirmed in several studies. Recently, a few cohort studies have looked at particular neurocognitive outcomes, and several have implicated hyperactivity. Objectives In order to confirm these findings, further information and results are required. Here, we assess whether paracetamol intake between 18 and 32 weeks gestation is associated with childhood behavioural and cognitive outcomes using a large population. Methods Data collected by the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) at 32 weeks gestation and referring to the period from 18 to 32 weeks, identified 43.9\% of women having taken paracetamol. We used an exposome analysis first to determine the background factors associated with pregnant women taking the drug, and then allowed for those factors to assess associations with child outcomes (measured using regression analyses). Results We identified 15 variables independently associated with taking paracetamol in this time period, which were used as potential confounders. Of the 135 neurocognitive variables considered, adjusting for the likelihood of false discovery, we identified 56 outcomes for adjusted analyses. Adjustment identified 12 showing independent associations with paracetamol use at P {$<$} .05, four of which were at P {$<$} .0001 (all related to child behaviours reported by the mother at 42 and 47 months; eg conduct problems: adjusted mean score + 0.22 (95\% confidence interval 0.10, 0.33)). There were few associations with behavioural or neurocognitive outcomes after age 7-8 years, whether reported by the mother or the teacher. Conclusions If paracetamol use in mid-to-late pregnancy has an adverse effect on child neurocognitive outcome, it appears to mainly relate to the pre-school period. It is important that these results be tested using other datasets or methodologies before assuming that they are causal.},

However, whether there is inflammasome activation in the amniotic cavity of women with PTL and intra-amniotic infection (IAI) or sterile intra-amniotic inflammation (SIAI) is unknown. METHOD OF STUDY: Amniotic fluid samples were collected from women with PTL who delivered at term (n~=~31) or preterm without IAI or SIAI (n~=~35), with SIAI (n~=~27), or with IAI (n~=~17). As a readout of inflammasome activation, extracellular ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) was measured in amniotic fluid by ELISA and the expression of ASC, caspase-1, and interleukin (IL)-1{$\beta$} was detected in the chorioamniotic membranes by multiplex immunofluorescence. Acute inflammatory responses in amniotic fluid and the placenta were also evaluated. RESULTS: (a) Amniotic fluid concentrations of ASC and IL-6 were higher in women with PTL and IAI or SIAI than in those who delivered preterm or at term without intra-amniotic inflammation; (b) amniotic fluid concentrations of ASC and IL-6 were lower in women with PTL and SIAI than in those with IAI; (c) there was a significant nonlinear correlation between ASC and IL-6 amniotic fluid concentrations; (d) the expression of inflammasome-related proteins (ASC, caspase-1, and IL-1{$\beta$}) in the chorioamniotic membranes was increased in women with PTL and IAI or SIAI than in those who delivered preterm or at term without intra-amniotic inflammation; (e) inflammasome activation in the chorioamniotic membranes was weaker in women with PTL and SIAI than in those with IAI; (f) women with PTL and IAI had elevated amniotic fluid white blood cell counts compared to those without this clinical condition; and (g) severe acute placental inflammatory lesions were observed in women with PTL and IAI and in a subset of women with PTL and SIAI.

  abstract = {Background The inflammasome has been implicated in the mechanisms that lead to spontaneous labor at term. However, whether the inflammasome is activated in the amniotic cavity of women with clinical chorioamnionitis at term is unknown. Herein, by measuring extracellular ASC [apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a C-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD)], we investigated whether there is in vivo inflammasome activation in amniotic fluid of patients with clinical chorioamnionitis at term with sterile intra-amniotic inflammation and in those with intra-amniotic infection. Methods This was a retrospective cross-sectional study that included amniotic fluid samples collected from 76 women who delivered after spontaneous term labor with diagnosed clinical chorioamnionitis. Intra-amniotic inflammation was defined as an elevated amniotic fluid interleukin (IL)-6 concentration {$\geq$}2.6 ng/mL, and intra-amniotic infection was diagnosed by the presence of microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (MIAC) accompanied by intra-amniotic inflammation. Patients were classified into the following groups: (1) women without intra-amniotic inflammation or infection (n=16); (2) women with MIAC but without intra-amniotic inflammation (n=5); (3) women with sterile intra-amniotic inflammation (n=15); and (4) women with intra-amniotic infection (n=40). As a readout of in vivo inflammasome activation, extracellular ASC was measured in amniotic fluid by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Acute inflammatory responses in the amniotic fluid and placenta were also evaluated. Results In clinical chorioamnionitis at term: (1) amniotic fluid concentrations of ASC (extracellular ASC is indicative of in vivo inflammasome activation) and IL-6 were greater in women with intra-amniotic infection than in those without intra-amniotic inflammation, regardless of the presence of MIAC; (2) amniotic fluid concentrations of ASC and IL-6 were also higher in women with sterile intra-amniotic inflammation than in those without intra-amniotic inflammation, regardless of the presence of MIAC; (3) amniotic fluid concentrations of IL-6, but not ASC, were more elevated in women with intra-amniotic infection than in those with sterile intra-amniotic inflammation; (4) a positive and significant correlation was observed between amniotic fluid concentrations of ASC and IL-6; (5) no differences were observed in amniotic fluid ASC and IL-6 concentrations between women with and without MIAC in the absence of intra-amniotic inflammation; (6) women with intra-amniotic infection had elevated white blood cell counts and reduced glucose levels in amniotic fluid compared to the other three study groups; and (7) women with intra-amniotic infection presented higher frequencies of acute maternal and fetal inflammatory responses in the placenta than those with sterile intra-amniotic inflammation. Conclusion The intra-amniotic inflammatory response, either induced by alarmins or microbes, is characterized by the activation of the inflammasome - as evidenced by elevated amniotic fluid concentrations of extracellular ASC - in women with clinical chorioamnionitis at term. These findings provide insight into the intra-amniotic inflammatory response in women with clinical chorioamnionitis at term.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Recent technology has made it possible to measure DNA methylation profiles in a cost-effective and comprehensive genome-wide manner using array-based technology for epigenome-wide association studies. However, identifying differentially methylated regions (DMRs) remains a challenging task because of the complexities in DNA methylation data. Supervised methods typically focus on the regions that contain consecutive highly significantly differentially methylated CpGs in the genome, but may lack power for detecting small but consistent changes when few CpGs pass stringent significance threshold after multiple comparison. Unsupervised methods group CpGs based on genomic annotations first and then test them against phenotype, but may lack specificity because the regional boundaries of methylation are often not well defined. We present coMethDMR, a flexible, powerful, and accurate tool for identifying DMRs. Instead of testing all CpGs within a genomic region, coMethDMR carries out an additional step that selects co-methylated sub-regions first. Next, coMethDMR tests association between methylation levels within the sub-region and phenotype via a random coefficient mixed effects model that models both variations between CpG sites within the region and differential methylation simultaneously. coMethDMR offers well-controlled Type I error rate, improved specificity, focused testing of targeted genomic regions, and is available as an open-source R package.},

  abstract = {Agricultural and residential use of organophosphate (OP) pesticides has increased in recent decades after banning some persistent pesticides. Although there is evidence of the effects of OPs on neurodevelopment and behaviour in adults, limited information is available about their effects in children, who might be more vulnerable to neurotoxic compounds. This paper was aimed at analysing the scientific evidence published to date on potential neurodevelopmental and behavioural effects of prenatal and postnatal exposure to OPs. A systematic review was undertaken to identify original articles published up to December 2012 evaluating prenatal or postnatal exposure to OPs in children and effects on neurodevelopment and/or behaviour. Articles were critically compared, focusing on the methodology used to assess exposure and adverse effects, as well as potential contributing factors that may modify both exposure and outcomes, such as genetic susceptibility to certain enzymes involved in OPs metabolisation (e.g. paraoxonase-1) and gender differences. Twenty articles met the inclusion criteria, 7 of which evaluated prenatal exposure to OPs, 8 postnatal exposure and 5 both pre- and postnatal exposure. Most of the studies evaluating prenatal exposure observed a negative effect on mental development and an increase in attention problems in preschool and school children. The evidence on postnatal exposure is less consistent, although 2 studies found an increase in reaction time in schoolchildren. Some paraoxonase-1 polymorphisms could enhance the association between OPs exposure and mental and psychomotor development. A large variability in epidemiological designs and methodologies used for assessing exposure and outcome was observed across the different studies, which made comparisons difficult. Prenatal and to a lesser extent postnatal exposure to OPs may contribute to neurodevelopmental and behavioural deficits in preschool and school children. Standardised methodologies are needed to allow results to be better compared and to perform a quantitative meta-analysis before drawing any final conclusions.},

  abstract = {Background Prenatal exposure to environmental pollutants such as mold, lead, pesticides, tobacco, and air pollutants has been suggested to impair cognitive development. Evidence is needed from longitudinal studies to understand their joint impact on child development across time. Objective To study associations between exposure to indoor environmental pollutants or outdoor air pollution during pregnancy and offspring cognitive development trajectories through 7 years. Methods We included 718 Mexican mother-child pairs. Prenatal exposure to indoor environmental pollutants (mold, ventilation, pesticides, tobacco smoke, and use of vidiartred clay pots) was self-reported by the mothers and integrated into an index, or objectively measured in the case of outdoor air pollutants (nitrogen oxides, benzene, toluene, and xylene). Child global cognitive development was measured at 12, 18, 60, or 84 months. Using Latent Class Growth Analysis, we identified three developmental trajectories (positive=108, average=362, low=248). We used multinomial logistic models to test associations between environmental pollutant score (EPS) or outdoor air pollutants, and cognitive development trajectories. Results After adjustment for sociodemographic covariates, EPS was associated with the average (OR=1.26 95\%CI=1.01, 1.55) and low (OR=1.41 95\%CI=1.11, 1.79) trajectories compared to positive; where a unit increase in EPS means an additional prenatal exposure to a pollutant. There was no association between outdoor air pollutants and cognitive development trajectories. Conclusion Children of women who reported higher exposure to indoor environmental pollutants during pregnancy were more likely to follow worse developmental trajectories through 7 years. These results support the development and testing of interventions to reduce exposure to environmental pollutants during pregnancy and early childhood as a potential strategy to improve long-term cognitive development.},

Methods: We conducted multiple linear regression in n\,=\,567 infants at birth, n\,=\,288 children at 1~year, and n\,=\,294 children at 3~years from the Newborn Epigenetics Study (NEST). We stratified by sex and adjusted for race/ethnicity, maternal education, maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, prenatal smoking, maternal age, gestational age, and paternal race. We also conducted analysis restricting to infants not born small for gestational age. Results: We found an association between higher methylation of the sequences regulating paternally expressed gene 10 (PEG10) and anthropometric z scores at 1~year ({$\beta$}\,=\,0.84; 95\% CI\,=\,0.34, 1.33; p\,=\,0.001) and 3~years ({$\beta$}\,=\,1.03; 95\% CI\,=\,0.37, 1.69; p value\,=\,0.003) in males only. Higher methylation of the DMR regulating mesoderm-specific transcript (MEST) was associated with lower anthropometric z scores in females at 1~year ({$\beta$}\,=\,-\,1.03; 95\% CI -\,1.60, -\,0.45; p value\,=\,0.001) and 3~years ({$\beta$}\,=\,-\,1.11; 95\% CI -\,1.98, -\,0.24; p value\,=\,0.01). These associations persisted when we restricted to infants not born small for gestational age. Conclusion: Our data support a sex-specific association between altered methylation and weight status in early life. These methylation marks can contribute to the compendium of epigenetically regulated regions detectable at birth, influencing obesity in childhood. Larger studies are required to confirm these findings.},

  abstract = {Objective: To provide the first explicit evaluation of the dimensionality of the total difficulties score of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), a widely used measure of child mental health. We do so by validating the SDQ across its full range against the prevalence of clinical disorder. Method: We use two large (n = 18,415) nationally-representative surveys of children and adolescents aged 5 to 16 years in the general British population. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires were completed separately by parents, teachers, and children aged 11 to 16 years, and children also received a multi-informant clinician-rated clinical diagnosis. Approximately 7,912 children from the baseline survey were also reassessed for clinical diagnosis at 3-year follow-up. Results: Across the full range of the parent, teacher, and youth SDQ, children with higher total difficulty scores have greater psychopathology as judged by the prevalence of clinical disorder. This was true cross-sectionally and also in predicting to disorder status 3 years later. There was no evidence of threshold effects for the SDQ at either high or low scores, but rather the odds of disorder increased at a constant rate across the range (odds ratios between 1.14 and 1.28 per 1-point increase in SDQ score). Conclusions: Our findings support the use of the SDQ as a genuinely dimensional measure of child mental health. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry, 2009;48(4):400Y403.

Participants ( n \,=\,247) from the Early Life Exposures in Mexico to Environmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) birth cohorts were followed-up once between the ages of 8 and 14 years, and concurrent exposures were measured in biospecimen collected at that time (blood Pb, urinary BPA, and phthalate metabolites). Prenatal and childhood exposures to Pb were previously approximated using maternal and child samples. BPA and phthalate metabolites were measured in third trimester maternal urine samples. Significant associations ( P \,{$<$}\,0.05) were observed between DNA methylation and exposure biomarkers that were gene and biomarker specific. For example, Pb was only associated with LINE-1 hypomethylation during pregnancy ( P \,=\,0.04), while early childhood Pb was instead associated with H19 hypermethylation ( P \,=\,0.04). Concurrent urinary mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) was associated with HSD11B2 hypermethylation ( P \,=\,0.005). Sex-specific associations, particularly among males, were also observed. In addition to single exposure models, principal component analysis was employed to examine exposure mixtures. This method largely corroborated the findings of the single exposure models.

This pilot study was designed to characterize exposures to phthalates, phenols and metals among pregnant women in the first trimester, and to examine associations with fetal biometrics and birth weight. A total of 41 chemicals and elements were analyzed in urine from 56 mothers with full-term newborns from the Michigan Mother\textendash Infant Pairs study. Bivariate analyses identified predictors of exposure biomarkers. Associations between birth weight, Fenton               z               -scores and second trimester fetal biometrics with toxicants were examined via multivariable linear regression. An average of 30 toxicants were detected in maternal urine. Fast food consumption was associated with several phthalate metabolites, phenols and metals, and canned food consumption with bisphenol F (               P               {$<$}0.05). Mono (3-carboxypropyl) phthalate was significantly associated with higher birth weight and Fenton               z               -score while the opposite was observed for bisphenol S. Estimated femur length from ultrasonography was significantly inversely associated with arsenic, barium and lead. While limited by sample size, this study is one of the first to evaluate birth outcomes with respect to emerging endocrine disrupting chemicals and to examine associations between toxicants and fetal biometrics. Exposure assessment was provided by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences' Children's Health Exposure Analysis Resource (NIEHS CHEAR), a resource available to children's studies with the goal of combining data across cohorts in an effort to characterize the impact of toxicants on child health from birth and beyond.},

To address when and how this fundamental process is initiated in mammals, we characterize transcriptomes of all individual cells throughout mouse pre-implantation development. This identifies targets of master pluripotency regulators Oct4 and Sox2 as being highly heterogeneously expressed between blastomeres of the 4-cell embryo, with Sox21 showing one of the most heterogeneous expression profiles. Live-cell tracking demonstrates that cells with decreased Sox21 yield more extra-embryonic than pluripotent progeny. Consistently, decreasing Sox21 results in premature upregulation of the differentiation regulator Cdx2, suggesting that Sox21 helps safeguard pluripotency. Furthermore, Sox21 is elevated following increased expression of the histone H3R26-methylase CARM1 and is lowered following CARM1 inhibition, indicating the importance of epigenetic regulation. Therefore, our results indicate that heterogeneous gene expression, as early as the 4-cell stage, initiates cell-fate decisions by modulating the balance of pluripotency and differentiation.},

  abstract = {Phthalates are commonly included as ingredients in personal care products such as cosmetics, shampoos and perfumes. Diethyl phthalate (DEP) has been found to be anti-androgenic and linked with adverse reproductive effects on males, but effects on females are poorly understood. We designed an integrative and translational study to experimentally examine the effects of DEP exposure at a human-equivalent dose on the mammary transcriptome in rats and to subsequently examine the DEP gene signature in breast tissues (both pre-malignant and tumor) from a population study. In Sprague-Dawley rats treated orally with DEP from birth to adulthood, we identified a signature panel of 107 genes predominantly down-regulated by DEP exposure. Univariate analysis of this 107 DEP gene signature in pre-malignant breast tissues revealed that six genes (P4HA1, MPZL3, TMC4, PLEKHA6, CA8, AREG) were inversely associated with monoethyl phthalate (MEP; the urinary metabolite of DEP) concentration (p\,{$<$}\,0.05) among postmenopausal women; all six genes loaded on to one of seven factors identified by factor analysis. Transcription factor enrichment analysis revealed that genes in this factor were enriched for androgen receptor binding sites. These six genes were also significantly down-regulated in pre-malignant adjacent tissues compared to the corresponding tumor tissues in pair-wise analyses (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). Results from our translational study indicate that low level exposure to diethyl phthalate results in measurable genomic changes in breast tissue with implications in breast carcinogenesis.},

  abstract = {Aging is associated with widespread changes in genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation. Thousands of CpG sites whose tissue-specific methylation levels are strongly correlated with chronological age have been previously identified. However, the majority of these studies have focused primarily on cosmopolitan populations living in the developed world; it is not known if agerelated patterns of DNA methylation at these loci are similar across a broad range of human genetic and ecological diversity. We investigated genome-wide methylation patterns using saliva- and whole blood-derived DNA from two traditionally hunting and gathering African populations: the Baka of the western Central African rain forest and the 6{$\frac{1}{4}$}Khomani San of the South African Kalahari Desert. We identified hundreds of CpG sites whose methylation levels are significantly associated with age, thousands that are significant in a meta-analysis, and replicate trends previously reported in populations of non-African descent. We confirmed that an age-associated site in the promoter of the gene ELOVL2 shows a remarkably congruent relationship with aging in humans, despite extensive genetic and environmental variation across populations. We also demonstrate that genotype state at methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) can affect methylation trends at some age-associated CpG sites. Our study explores the relationship between CpG methylation and chronological age in populations of African hunter-gatherers, who rely on different diets across diverse ecologies. While many age-related CpG sites replicate across populations, we show that considering common genetic variation at meQTLs further improves our ability to detect previously identified age associations.},

  abstract = {Genomic imprinting disorders often exhibit delayed neurobehavioral development, suggesting this unique mechanism of epigenetic regulation plays a role in mental and neurological health. While major errors in imprinting have been linked to adverse health outcomes, there has been little research conducted on how moderate variability in imprinted gene expression within a population contributes to differences in neurobehavioral outcomes, particularly at birth. Here, we profiled the expression of 108 known and putative imprinted genes in human placenta samples from 615 infants assessed by the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) Network Neurobehavioral Scales (NNNS). Data reduction identified 10 genes (DLX5, DHCR24, VTRNA2-1, PHLDA2, NPAP1, FAM50B, GNAS-AS1, PAX8-AS1, SHANK2, and COPG2IT1) whose expression could distinguish between newborn neurobehavioral profiles derived from the NNNS. Clustering infants based on the expression pattern of these genes identified 2 groups of infants characterized by reduced quality of movement, increased signs of asymmetrical and non-optimal reflexes, and increased odds of demonstrating increased signs of physiologic stress and abstinence. Overall, these results suggest that common variation in placental imprinted gene expression is linked to suboptimal performance on scales of neurological functioning as well as with increased signs of physiologic stress, highlighting the central importance of the control of expression of these genes in the placenta for neurobehavioral development.},

  abstract = {Background: Arsenic is one of the most commonly encountered environmental toxicants, and research from model systems has suggested that one mode of its toxic activity may be through alterations in DNA methylation. In utero exposure to arsenic can affect fetal, newborn, and infant health, resulting in a range of phenotypic outcomes. Objectives: This study examined variation in placental DNA methylation and its relationship to arsenic exposure in 343 individuals enrolled in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study. Methods: Linear regression models using a reference-free correction to account for cellular composition were employed to determine CpG loci affected by arsenic levels. Results: Total arsenic measured in maternal urine during the second trimester was not associated with methylation in the placenta, whereas arsenic levels quantified through maternal toenail collected at birth were associated with methylation at a single CpG locus (p = 4.1 \texttimes{} 10\textendash 8). Placenta arsenic levels were associated with 163 differentially methylated loci (false discovery rate {$<$} 0.05), with 11 probes within the LYRM2 gene reaching genome-wide significance (p {$<$} 10\textendash 8). Measurement of LYRM2 mRNA levels indicated that methylation was weakly to moderately correlated with expression (r = 0.15, p {$<$} 0.06). In addition, we identified pathways suggesting changes in placental cell subpopulation proportions associated with arsenic exposure. Conclusions: These data demonstrate the potential for arsenic, even at levels commonly experienced in a U.S. population, to have effects on the DNA methylation status of specific genes in the placenta and thus supports a potentially novel mechanism for arsenic to affect long-term c\- hildren's health.},

  abstract = {The cellular expression, structure and function of endoglin, and its implication in several vascular disorders remain enigmatic, even 30 years after its discovery. Endoglin (CD105) is a homodimeric glycoprotein (180~kDa) constitutively expressed in the vascular endothelium. It is essential for cardiovascular development and mutations in the ENG gene lead to Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia, a disorder characterized by arteriovenous malformations. Endoglin is also expressed in the syncytiotrophoblast throughout pregnancy, but transiently upregulated in the extravillous trophoblast of anchoring villi. Endoglin modulates responses to several TGF-{$\beta$} superfamily ligands and is essential for the negative regulation by TGF-{$\beta$} isoforms 1 and 3 of extravillous trophoblast differentiation. Membrane endoglin binds endothelial NO synthase and regulates its activation and vasomotor tone. There is also a circulating soluble form of endoglin (sEng; 65~kDa); its levels in the serum of women with preeclampsia are increased and correlated with disease severity. The exact sequence of sEng is still unresolved and the proposed mechanism of release from the syncytium by metalloproteases would not yield the expected size protein. The nature of the ligand sequestered by sEng is also an enigma. sEng is said to block the effects of TGF-{$\beta$} on NO-mediated vasorelaxation. However, sEng alone cannot scavenge these ligands for which it has very low affinity. sEng binds with high affinity to BMP9, which stimulates secretion from endothelial cells of the vascoconstrictor endothelin-1, also implicated in endothelial cell stabilization. It remains to be determined if scavenging of circulating BMP9 by sEng is important in preeclampsia and regulation of hypertension.},

Using immunocytochemistry, we demonstrated 95\% purity for cytotrophoblasts and 60\textendash 70\% for fibroblasts. We compared DNA methylation profiles from cytotrophoblasts, fibroblasts and whole placental villi using bisulfite modified genomic DNA hybridized to the Illumina Methylation27 array. Euclidean cluster analysis of the DNA methylation profiles showed two main clusters, one containing cytotrophoblasts and placenta, the other fibroblasts. Differential methylation analysis identified 442 autosomal CpG sites that differed between cytotrophoblasts and fibroblasts, 315 between placenta and fibroblasts and 61 between placenta and cytotrophoblasts. Three candidate methylation differences were validated by targeted pyrosequencing assays. Pyrosequencing assays were developed for CpG sites less methylated in cytotrophoblasts than fibroblasts mapping to the promoter region of the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin 5 (CGB5), as well as two CpG sites mapping to each of two tumor suppressor genes. Our data suggest that epigenetic regulation of gene expression is likely to be a key factor in the functional specificity of cytotrophoblasts. These data are proof of principle for cell-type specific epigenetic regulation in placenta and demonstrate that the methylation profile of placenta is mainly driven by cytotrophoblasts.},

Environmental factors can influence gene expression and cell function by modifying epigenetic marks, impacting the developing embryo as well as future generations of offspring. The impact of phthalates on placental gene methylation and expression is largely unknown. We studied the effect of maternal phthalate exposure on the human placental DNA methylome and transcriptome. We determined epigenome-wide DNA methylation marks (Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 850k BeadChip) and gene expression (Agilent whole human genome array) associated with phthalate exposure in first trimester placenta. Integrative genomic analysis of candidate genes was performed to define gene methylation-expression relationships. We identified 39 genes with significantly altered methylation and gene expression in the high phthalate exposure group. Most of these relationships were inversely correlated. This analysis identified epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a critical candidate gene mediating the effects of phthalates on early placental function. Although additional studies are needed to determine the functional consequences of these changes, our findings are consistent with the model that phthalates impact placental function by modulating the expression of critical placental genes through epigenetic regulation.},

  abstract = {Background Bisphenol A (BPA) is commonly used in the manufacture of plastics and epoxy resins. In North America, over 90\% of the population has detectable levels of urinary BPA. Human epidemiological studies have reported adverse behavioral outcomes with BPA exposure in children, however, corresponding effects on children's brain structure have not yet been investigated. The current study examined the association between prenatal maternal and childhood BPA exposure and white matter microstructure in children aged 2 to 5\,years, and investigated whether brain structure mediated the association between BPA exposure and child behavior. Methods Participants were 98 mother-child pairs who were recruited between January 2009 and December 2012. Total BPA concentrations in spot urine samples obtained from mothers in the second trimester of pregnancy and from children at 3\textendash 4\,years of age were analyzed. Children participated in a diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan at age 2\textendash 5\,years (3.7 {$\pm$} 0.8\,years). Associations between prenatal maternal and childhood BPA and children's fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity of 10 isolated white matter tracts were investigated, controlling for urinary creatinine, child sex, and age at the time of MRI. Post-hoc analyses examined if alterations in white matter mediated the relationship of BPA and children's scores on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Results Prenatal maternal urinary BPA was significantly associated with child mean diffusivity in the splenium and right inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Splenium diffusivity mediated the relationship between maternal prenatal BPA levels and children's internalizing behavior (indirect effect: {$\beta$}\,=\,0.213, CI [0.0167, 0.564]). No significant associations were found between childhood BPA and white matter microstructure. Conclusions This study provides preliminary evidence for the neural correlates of BPA exposure in humans. Our findings suggest that prenatal maternal exposure to BPA may lead to alterations in white matter microstructure in preschool aged children, and that such alterations mediate the relationship between early life exposure to BPA and internalizing problems.},

The use of routinely collected health data represents one approach to better identifying, quantifying, and understanding the long-term risks or benefits of medication use during pregnancy. As such, the objective of this review was to identify and explore opportunities and challenges associated with using routinely collected health data to examine long-term effects of medication use during pregnancy. Drawing on published research several key methodological issues associated with their use in investigating long-term outcomes are reviewed. While significant opportunities exist to make greater use of routinely collected health data, there are a number of key challenges. Identified challenges relate to aspects of study design and analysis, and include obtaining access to data, the ability to match records across datasets and over long periods of time, how medication exposures are ascertained and classified, issues around loss to follow-up how outcomes are ascertained and classified, and the careful interpretation of results in light of study and data limitations. Understanding key challenges associated with using routinely collected health data to investigate long-term effects of medication use during pregnancy is essential in supporting their appropriate use and interpretation, which will contribute to improving the quality of research undertaken and ensure the reliability of results obtained.},

Indigenous Bolivians (Andean Native Americans) residing for generations at high altitudes have higher birth weights relative to more recent migrants of primarily European ancestry. Previous research demonstrated that the placenta is a key contributor to the preservation of Andean birth weight at high altitude. Our current research investigated how gene expression and epigenetics contributes to the conservation of birth weight at high altitude by examining mRNA expression and DNA methylation differences between placentas of Andeans and those of European ancestry residing at high and low altitude.                                   Methods             : Genome-wide mRNA expression and DNA methylation of villous placenta tissue was quantified utilizing microarray technology. Subjects were of Andean and European ancestry and resident at high (3600m) or low (400m) altitudes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with altitude or ancestry were identified (FDR{$<$}0.1, |fold change|{$>$}1.25). To predict which DEGs could be regulated by methylation we tested for correlation between gene expression and methylation values.                                   Results             : 69 DEGs associated with altitude (n=36) or ancestry (n=34) were identified. Altitude-associated DEGs included members of the AP-1 transcription factor family. Ancestry-associated DEGs were implicated in inflammatory pathways and associated with pro-angiogenic macrophages. More ancestry-associated DEGs correlated significantly (n=17) (FDR{$<$}0.1) with promoter or gene body methylation (p=0.0242) when compared to altitude associated DEGs (n=8).                                   Conclusions:             Compared to altitude-associated DEGs, methylation regulates more ancestry-associated DEGs, potentially allowing for rapid modification in the expression of inflammatory genes to attract pro-angiogenic macrophages as a means of promoting placental capillary growth in Andeans, regardless of altitude.},

  abstract = {Regression problems with many potential candidate predictor variables occur in a wide variety of scientific fields and business applications. These problems require you to perform statistical model selection to find an optimal model, one that is as simple as possible while still providing good predictive performance. Traditional stepwise selection methods, such as forward and backward selection, suffer from high variability and low prediction accuracy, especially when there are many predictor variables or correlated predictor variables (or both). In the last decade, the higher prediction accuracy and computational efficiency of penalized regression methods have made them an attractive alternative to traditional selection methods. This paper first provides a brief review of the LASSO, adaptive LASSO, and elastic net penalized model selection methods. Then it explains how to perform model selection by applying these techniques with the GLMSELECT procedure, which includes extensive customization options and powerful graphs for steering statistical model selection.},

Abnormalities in their regulation can result in placental and embryonic dysplasia, leading to congenital diseases. The imprinting state, expression, and function of aquaporin-1 (Aqp1) were explored in knockout mice by imprinting analysis, real-time PCR, and immunohistochemistry. In the present study, Aqp1 was identified as a new, imprinted, and placenta-specific maternally expressed gene in the mouse. Compared with wild-type Aqp1(+/+) mice, there was significant placental and embryonic overgrowth in Aqp1(-/+) (loss of maternal allele) and Aqp1(-/-) mice, but not in Aqp1(+/-) (loss of paternal allele) mice at Embryonic Day (E) 12.5-E18.5. In addition, the masses of Postnatal Day 0 (P0) embryos (Aqp1(-/-) and Aqp1(-/+)) were highest among the four types. In Aqp1(-/+) and Aqp1(-/-) mice, phenotypic analysis indicated that the number and branching of blood vessels, as well as the labyrinth area, increased significantly in placentae of E12.5-E18.5 mice. Moreover, there were abnormalities in the placental junctional zone and the labyrinthine zone at E15.5. Quantitative analysis showed that Aqp1 expression decreased significantly in the placentae of Aqp1(-/+) and Aqp1(-/-) mice at E15.5, and that the AQP1 protein expression signals were detected weakly in the decidual and spongioblast layers. Our results demonstrate that Aqp1 is maternally expressed in the placenta, and that its deficiency resulted in placental abnormalities in the mouse. Aqp1 may have a specific inhibitory role in mouse placental development. These results provide new insights for the treatment of diseases relating to placental and embryonic development.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The spectrum of disorders of the brain is large, covering hundreds of disorders that are listed in either the mental or neurological disorder chapters of the established international diagnostic classification systems. These disorders have a high prevalence as well as short- and long-term impairments and disabilities. Therefore they are an emotional, financial and social burden to the patients, their families and their social network. In a 2005 landmark study, we estimated for the first time the annual cost of 12 major groups of disorders of the brain in Europe and gave a conservative estimate of \texteuro 386 billion for the year 2004. This estimate was limited in scope and conservative due to the lack of sufficiently comprehensive epidemiological and/or economic data on several important diagnostic groups. We are now in a position to substantially improve and revise the 2004 estimates. In the present report we cover 19 major groups of disorders, 7 more than previously, of an increased range of age groups and more cost items. We therefore present much improved cost estimates. Our revised estimates also now include the new EU member states, and hence a population of 514 million people. AIMS: To estimate the number of persons with defined disorders of the brain in Europe in 2010, the total cost per person related to each disease in terms of direct and indirect costs, and an estimate of the total cost per disorder and country. METHODS: The best available estimates of the prevalence and cost per person for 19 groups of disorders of the brain (covering well over 100 specific disorders) were identified via a systematic review of the published literature. Together with the twelve disorders included in 2004, the following range of mental and neurologic groups of disorders is covered: addictive disorders, affective disorders, anxiety disorders, brain tumor, childhood and adolescent disorders (developmental disorders), dementia, eating disorders, epilepsy, mental retardation, migraine, multiple sclerosis, neuromuscular disorders, Parkinson's disease, personality disorders, psychotic disorders, sleep disorders, somatoform disorders, stroke, and traumatic brain injury. Epidemiologic panels were charged to complete the literature review for each disorder in order to estimate the 12-month prevalence, and health economic panels were charged to estimate best cost-estimates. A cost model was developed to combine the epidemiologic and economic data and estimate the total cost of each disorder in each of 30 European countries (EU27+Iceland, Norway and Switzerland). The cost model was populated with national statistics from Eurostat to adjust all costs to 2010 values, converting all local currencies to Euro, imputing costs for countries where no data were available, and aggregating country estimates to purchasing power parity adjusted estimates for the total cost of disorders of the brain in Europe 2010. RESULTS: The total cost of disorders of the brain was estimated at \texteuro 798 billion in 2010. Direct costs constitute the majority of costs (37\% direct healthcare costs and 23\% direct non-medical costs) whereas the remaining 40\% were indirect costs associated with patients' production losses. On average, the estimated cost per person with a disorder of the brain in Europe ranged between \texteuro 285 for headache and \texteuro 30,000 for neuromuscular disorders. The European per capita cost of disorders of the brain was \texteuro 1550 on average but varied by country. The cost (in billion \texteuro PPP 2010) of the disorders of the brain included in this study was as follows: addiction: \texteuro 65.7; anxiety disorders: \texteuro 74.4; brain tumor: \texteuro 5.2; child/adolescent disorders: \texteuro 21.3; dementia: \texteuro 105.2; eating disorders: \texteuro 0.8; epilepsy: \texteuro 13.8; headache: \texteuro 43.5; mental retardation: \texteuro 43.3; mood disorders: \texteuro 113.4; multiple sclerosis: \texteuro 14.6; neuromuscular disorders: \texteuro 7.7; Parkinson's disease: \texteuro 13.9; personality disorders: \texteuro 27.3; psychotic disorders: \texteuro 93.9; sleep disorders: \texteuro 35.4; somatoform disorder: \texteuro 21.2; stroke: \texteuro 64.1; traumatic brain injury: \texteuro 33.0. It should be noted that the revised estimate of those disorders included in the previous 2004 report constituted \texteuro 477 billion, by and large confirming our previous study results after considering the inflation and population increase since 2004. Further, our results were consistent with administrative data on the health care expenditure in Europe, and comparable to previous studies on the cost of specific disorders in Europe. Our estimates were lower than comparable estimates from the US. DISCUSSION: This study was based on the best currently available data in Europe and our model enabled extrapolation to countries where no data could be found. Still, the scarcity of data is an important source of uncertainty in our estimates and may imply over- or underestimations in some disorders and countries. Even though this review included many disorders, diagnoses, age groups and cost items that were omitted in 2004, there are still remaining disorders that could not be included due to limitations in the available data. We therefore consider our estimate of the total cost of the disorders of the brain in Europe to be conservative. In terms of the health economic burden outlined in this report, disorders of the brain likely constitute the number one economic challenge for European health care, now and in the future. Data presented in this report should be considered by all stakeholder groups, including policy makers, industry and patient advocacy groups, to reconsider the current science, research and public health agenda and define a coordinated plan of action of various levels to address the associated challenges. RECOMMENDATIONS: Political action is required in light of the present high cost of disorders of the brain. Funding of brain research must be increased; care for patients with brain disorders as well as teaching at medical schools and other health related educations must be quantitatively and qualitatively improved, including psychological treatments. The current move of the pharmaceutical industry away from brain related indications must be halted and reversed. Continued research into the cost of the many disorders not included in the present study is warranted. It is essential that not only the EU but also the national governments forcefully support these initiatives.},

Changes in DNA methylation patterns, an epigenetic modification required for various CNS functions are observed with brain aging and can be prevented by anti-aging interventions, but the relationship of altered methylation to gene expression is poorly understood. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Paired analysis of the hippocampal methylome and transcriptome with aging of male and female mice demonstrates that age-related differences in methylation and gene expression are anti-correlated within gene bod-ies and enhancers. Altered promoter methylation with aging was found to be generally un-related to altered gene expression. A more striking relationship was found between methylation levels at young age and differential gene expression with aging. Highly methylated gene bodies and promoters in early life were associated with age-related increases in gene expression even in the absence of significant methylation changes with aging. As well, low levels of methylation in early life were correlated to decreased expression with aging. This relationship was also observed in genes altered in two mouse Alzheimer's models. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} DNA methylation patterns established in youth, in combination with other epigenetic marks, were able to accurately predict changes in transcript trajectories with aging. These findings are consistent with the develop-mental origins of disease hypothesis and indicate that epigenetic variability in early life may explain differences in aging trajectories and age-related disease.},

We and others have previously shown~that human blastocysts might contain thousands of transient maternally methylated gDMRs (transient mDMRs), whose maternal methylation is lost in embryonic tissues after implantation. In this study, we performed genome-wide allelic DNA methylation analyses of purified trophoblast cells from human placentas and, surprisingly, found that more than one-quarter of the transient-in-embryo mDMRs maintained their maternally biased DNA methylation. RNA-sequencing-based allelic expression analyses revealed that some of the placenta-specific mDMRs were associated with expression of imprinted genes (e.g., TIGAR, SLC4A7, PROSER2-AS1, and KLHDC10), and three imprinted gene clusters were identified. This approach also identified some X-linked gDMRs. Comparisons of the data with those from other mammals revealed that genomic imprinting in the placenta is highly variable. These findings highlight the incomplete erasure of germline DNA methylation in the human placenta; understanding this erasure is important for understanding normal placental development and the pathogenesis of developmental disorders with imprinting effects.},

Such information may be derived from epidemiologic analyses; however, in the case where such evidence is unavailable, knowledge can be drawn from toxicologic studies or other experimental research. Unfortunately, using toxicologic findings to develop informative priors in epidemiologic analyses requires strong assumptions, with no established method for its utilization. We present a method to help bridge the gap between animal and cellular studies and epidemiologic research by specification of an order-constrained prior. We illustrate this approach using an example from radiation epidemiology.},

  abstract = {Background: Regulation of asbestos fibers in the workplace is partly determined by which fibers can be visually counted. However, a majority of fibers are too short and thin to count this way and are, consequently, not subject to regulation. Methods: We estimate lung cancer risk associated with asbestos fibers of varying length and width. We apply an order-constrained prior both to leverage external information from toxicological studies of asbestos health effects. This prior assumes that risk from asbestos fibers increases with increasing length and decreases with increasing width. Results: When we apply a shared mean for the effect of all asbestos fiber exposure groups, the rate ratios for each fiber group per unit exposure appear mostly equal. Rate ratio estimates for fibers of diameter {$<$}0.25 {$\mu$}m and length {$<$}1.5 and 1.5\textendash 5.0 {$\mu$}m are the most precise. When applying an order-constrained prior, we find that estimates of lung cancer rate ratio per unit of exposure to unregulated fibers 20\textendash 40 and {$>$}40 {$\mu$}m in the thinnest fiber group are similar in magnitude to estimates of risk associated with long fibers in the regulated fraction of airborne asbestos fibers. Rate ratio estimates for longer fibers are larger than those for shorter fibers, but thicker and thinner fibers do not differ as the toxicologically derived prior had expected. Conclusion: Credible intervals for fiber size-specific risk estimates overlap; thus, we cannot conclude that there are substantial differences in effect by fiber size. Nonetheless, our results suggest that some unregulated asbestos fibers may be associated with increased incidence of lung cancer.},

Two primary considerations are the form of the research question and the statistical tools best suited to address that question. Because the choice of statistical tools is not rigid, we make recommendations about when each tool may be most useful. Recent Findings When dimensionality is relatively low, some statistical tools yield easily interpretable estimates of effect (e.g., risk ratio, odds ratio) or intervention impacts. When dimensionality increases, it is often necessary to compromise this interpretablity in favor of identifying interesting statistical signals from noise; this requires applying statistical tools that are oriented more heavily towards dimension reduction via shrinkage and/or variable selection.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to endocrine disruptors is unavoidable. Many such compounds are suspected to impact neurologic development of children, but most studies conducted have considered effects of individual chemicals in isolation. Because exposures co-occur, it is important to consider their health impacts in a single regression framework. METHODS: We applied Bayesian statistical tools (including shared mean and mixture priors for 25 unique chemicals) to study independent associations of endocrine disruptor biomarkers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (n = 491) and intellectual disability (n = 155), compared with 373 general population controls, in the Early Markers for Autism study. We measured biomarkers in maternal serum collected and stored from midpregnancy and considered them individually or as a class (i.e., summed polychlorinated biphenyls). We adjusted all models for original matching factors (child sex and month and year of birth), maternal age, maternal race/ethnicity, parity, and maternal education at the time samples were collected. We estimated the change in the odds of ASD or intellectual disability per 1 SD increase in the z-score of measured biomarker concentration for each chemical. RESULTS: Odds of ASD and intellectual disability did not change with increasing concentration for any specific endocrine disruptor. The effect estimates for each chemical were centered on or near an odds ratio of 1.00 in both models where we applied a shared mean or a mixture prior. CONCLUSION: Our mixtures analyses do not suggest an independent relationship with ASD or intellectual disability with any of the 25 chemicals examined together in this mixtures analysis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Changes in DNA methylation may play an important role in the deleterious reproductive effects reported in association with exposure to environmental pollutants. In this pilot study, we identify candidate methylation changes associated with exposure to pollutants in women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). METHODS: Blood and urine were collected from women on the day of oocyte retrieval. Whole blood was analyzed for mercury and lead, and urine for cadmium using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Unconjugated bisphenol A (BPA) was analyzed in serum using high-performance liquid chromatography with Coularray detection. Participants were dichotomized as higher or lower exposure groups by median concentrations. Using the Illumina GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel I, DNA methylation in whole blood from 43 women was assessed at 1505 CpG sites for association with exposure levels of each pollutant. Candidate CpG sites were identified using a Diff Score {$>$}|13| (P{$<$} 0.05) and an absolute difference {$>$}10\% which were confirmed using bisulfite pyrosequencing. RESULTS: Methylation of the GSTM1/5 promoter was increased for women with higher mercury exposure (P= 0.04); however, no correlation was observed (r= 0.17, P= 0.27). Reduced methylation was detected in the COL1A2 promoter in women with higher exposure to lead (P= 0.004), and an inverse correlation was observed (r = - 0.45, P= 0.03). Lower methylation of a promoter CpG site at the TSP50 gene was detected in women with higher BPA exposure (P= 0.005), and again an inverse correlation was identified (r = - 0.51, P= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Altered DNA methylation at various CpG sites was associated with exposure to mercury, lead or BPA, providing candidates to be investigated using a larger study sample, as the results may reflect an independently associated predictor (e.g. socioeconomic status, diet, genetic variants, altered blood cell composition). Further studies accommodating variations in these factors will be needed to confirm these associations and identify their underlying causes.},

A few human studies also show prenatal and childhood BPA exposure to be associated with behavior problems in children. METHODS: We measured BPA in urine from mothers during pregnancy and children at 5 years of age (N=292). Child behavior was assessed by mother and teacher report at age 7 years and direct assessment at age 9 years. RESULTS: Prenatal urinary BPA concentrations were associated with increased internalizing problems in boys, including anxiety and depression, at age 7. No associations were seen with prenatal BPA concentrations and behaviors in girls. Childhood urinary BPA concentrations were associated with increased externalizing behaviors, including conduct problems, in girls at age 7 and increased internalizing behaviors and inattention and hyperactivity behaviors in boys and girls at age 7. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the existing literature showing associations of early life BPA exposure with behavior problems, including anxiety, depression, and hyperactivity in children. Additional information about timing of exposure and sex differences in effect is still needed.},

OBJECTIVES: We examined whether prenatal and postnatal urinary BPA concentrations were associated with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, percent body fat, and obesity in 9-year-old children (n = 311) in the CHAMACOS longitudinal cohort study. METHODS: BPA was measured in spot urine samples collected from mothers twice during pregnancy and from children at 5 and 9 years of age. RESULTS: Prenatal urinary BPA concentrations were associated with decreased BMI at 9 years of age in girls but not boys. Among girls, being in the highest tertile of prenatal BPA concentrations was associated with decreased BMI z-score ({$\beta$} = -0.47, 95\% CI: -0.87, -0.07) and percent body fat ({$\beta$} = -4.36, 95\% CI: -8.37, -0.34) and decreased odds of overweight/obesity [odds ratio (OR) = 0.37, 95\% CI: 0.16, 0.91] compared with girls in the lowest tertile. These findings were strongest in prepubertal girls. Urinary BPA concentrations at 5 years of age were not associated with any anthropometric parameters at 5 or 9 years, but BPA concentrations at 9 years were positively associated with BMI, waist circumference, fat mass, and overweight/obesity at 9 years in boys and girls. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with other cross-sectional studies, higher urinary BPA concentrations at 9 years of age were associated with increased adiposity at 9 years. However, increasing BPA concentrations in mothers during pregnancy were associated with decreased BMI, body fat, and overweight/obesity among their daughters at 9 years of age.},

We examined associations of prenatal and childhood PFAS exposure with performance on assessments of cognition in children. Methods: We included mother-child pairs from Project Viva, a longitudinal Boston-area birth cohort enrolled during 1999\textendash 2002. We quantified concentrations of eight PFASs, including perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), in plasma collected from women during pregnancy (median 9.7 weeks gestation) and from children at a visit in mid-childhood (median age 7.7 years). In early childhood (median age 3.2 years) we administered standardized assessments of visual motor skills and vocabulary comprehension, and in mid-childhood we assessed visual motor skills, visual memory, and verbal and non-verbal intelligence. Using multivariable regression, we estimated associations of prenatal and childhood PFAS plasma concentrations with children's cognitive assessment scores, adjusted for relevant covariates including breastfeeding, maternal intelligence, parental education, and household income. Samples sizes ranged from 631 to 971, depending on analysis. Results: Prenatal PFAS concentrations were associated with both better and worse cognitive performance; children with top quartile prenatal concentrations of some PFASs had better visual motor abilities in early childhood and non-verbal IQ and visual memory in mid-childhood, while children with upper quartile prenatal PFOA and PFOS had lower mid-childhood visual-motor scores. In cross-sectional analyses of mid-childhood PFAS concentrations and cognitive assessments, visual-motor scores on the Wide Range Assessment of Visual Motor Abilities (WRAVMA) (standardized mean = 100, standard deviation = 15) were lower among children with higher PFHxS (fourth quartile (Q4) vs. Q1: -5.0, 95\% confidence interval (CI): -9.1, -0.8). Upper quartiles of childhood PFOA and PFOS were also associated with somewhat lower childhood WRAVMA scores, but childhood PFASs were not associated with verbal or non-verbal IQ or visual memory. Conclusions: We present evidence suggesting associations of prenatal and childhood PFAS exposure with lower childhood visual motor abilities. Other results were inconsistent, with higher prenatal PFASs associated in some cases with better cognitive outcomes.},

We have conducted highresolution methylation specific bead chip microarray analyses assessing more than 450,000 CpGs analyzing placentas from 12 T21 pregnancies, 12 T18 pregnancies and 6 T13 pregnancies. We have compared the methylation landscape of the trisomic placentas to the methylation landscape from normal placental DNA and to maternal blood cell DNA. Comparing trisomic placentas to normal placentas we identified 217 and 219 differentially methylated CpGs for CVS T18 and CVS T13, respectively (delta {$\beta>$}0.2, FDR{$<$}0.05), but only three differentially methylated CpGs for T21. However, the methylation differences was only modest (delta {$\beta<$}0.4), making them less suitable as diagnostic markers. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that the gene set connected to theT18 differentially methylated CpGs was highly enriched for GO terms related to''DNA binding'' and ``transcription factor binding'' coupled to the RNA polymerase II transcription. In the gene set connected to the T13 differentially methylated CpGs we found no significant enrichments.},

A volume of only 150microl serum is used and protein precipitation by methanol is the only sample preparation necessary prior to injection into the column switching system. Pseudo-MRM is used as a detection mode for determination of PFCs, resulting in reduced background noise and considerably increased sensitivity for the perfluorinated alkyl sulfonates and the perfluorinated alkyl sulfonamides. The estimated limits of detection for the method were as low as 0.0020-0.050ngPFCs/ml serum. The accuracy determined from spiking experiments, reported as recovery of added amount, was between 85 and 121\% in the range 0.20-50ngPFC/ml serum, except for perfluorodecylsulfonate for which the accuracy was 146\% at 0.20ngPFC/ml serum. The low sample volume needed, the limited manual handling and the broad range of analytes which are included, make this method advantageous for large-scale epidemiological studies. This column-switching technique can easily be set up on standard LC-MS/MS instruments and is thus available to a wide range of laboratories.},

  abstract = {The GNAS1 gene encodes the \textvisiblespace{} subunit of the G protein Gs, which couples receptor binding by several hormones to activation of adenylate cyclase. Null mutations of GNAS1 cause pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) type Ia, in which hormone resistance occurs in association with a characteristic osteodystrophy. The observation that PHP Ia almost always is inherited maternally has led to the suggestion that GNAS1 may be an imprinted gene. Here, we show that, although Gs\textvisiblespace{} expression (directed by the promoter upstream of exon 1) is biallelic, GNAS1 is indeed imprinted in a promoter-specific fashion. We used parthenogenetic lymphocyte DNA to screen by restriction landmark genomic scanning for loci showing differential methylation between paternal and maternal alleles. This screen identified a region that was found to be methylated exclusively on a maternal allele and was located Ϸ35 kb upstream of GNAS1 exon 1. This region contains three novel exons that are spliced into alternative GNAS1 mRNA species, including one exon that encodes the human homologue of the large G protein XL\textvisiblespace s. Transcription of these novel mRNAs is exclusively from the paternal allele in all tissues examined. The differential imprinting of separate protein products of GNAS1 therefore may contribute to the anomalous inheritance of PHP Ia.},

Despite the popularity of multiple imputation of missing data, its acceptance and application still lag in large-scale studies with complicated datasets such as CanCORS. We use sequential regression multiple imputation, implemented in public-available software, to deal with nonresponse in the CanCORS surveys and construct a centralized completed database that can be easily used by investigators from multiple sites. Our work illustrates the feasibility of multiple imputation in a large-scale multiobjective survey, showing its capacity to handle complex missing data.

However, genome-wide analyses are scarce and cross-sectional analyses are hampered by many potential confounding factors. Moreover, causal relations are hard to identify due to the lack of controlled experimental designs. In the current study, we therefore combined a comprehensive assessment of genome-wide DNA methylation differences in people exposed to the great Chinese famine in utero with an in vitro study in which we deprived fibroblasts of nutrition. Methods: We compared whole blood DNA methylation differences between 25 individuals in utero exposed to famine and 54 healthy control individuals using the HumanMethylation450 platform. In vitro, we analyzed DNA methylation changes in 10 fibroblast cultures that were nutritionally deprived for 72 h by withholding fetal bovine serum. Results: We identified three differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in four genes (ENO2, ZNF226, CCDC51, and TMA7) that were related to famine exposure in both analyses. Pathway analysis with data from both Chinese famine samples and fibroblasts highlighted the nervous system and neurogenesis pathways as the most affected by nutritional deprivation. Conclusions: The combination of cross-sectional and experimental data provides indications that biological adaptation to famine leads to DNA methylation changes in genes involved in the central nervous system.},

Over the past 5 years, several human epidemiological studies have reported a positive association between BPA exposure and adverse health outcomes in children, including obesity, asthma, preterm birth, and neuro-behavioural disturbances. These findings are in conflict with international environmental risk assessment models, which predict daily exposure levels to BPA should not pose a risk to child health. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the evidence for different exposure sources and potential exposure pathways of BPA in early childhood. By collating the findings from experimental models and exposure associations observed in human bio-monitoring studies, we affirm the potential for non-dietary sources to make a substantial contribution to total daily exposure in young children. Infants and toddlers have distinctive exposure sources, physiology, and metabolism of endocrine-disrupting chemicals. We recommend risk-assessment models implement new frameworks, which specifically address exposure and hazard in early childhood. This is particularly important for BPA, which is present in numerous products in the home and day-care environments, and for which animal studies report contradictory findings on its safety at environmentally relevant levels of exposure.},

Empirical data are still scarce, but particularly studies investigating how the epigenome links early developmental and adult disease may rapidly change this situation. Recently, several reports showed that prenatal environmental conditions are associated with persistent changes of the human epigenome. The evaluation of candidate loci among individuals prenatally exposed to the Dutch Famine indicates that such changes may be common but individually relatively small and may greatly depend on the timing of the exposure during gestation. These findings suggest that the epigenomic contribution to disease risk may entail the combination of multiple changes especially when adaptive responses are involved to cope with environmental conditions. Well-designed epigenome-wide studies will be crucial in creating a catalog of epigenomic regions that are sensitive to the prenatal environment to evaluate developmental influences on common human disease.},

  abstract = {Statistical models support medical research by facilitating individualized outcome prognostication conditional on independent variables or by estimating effects of risk factors adjusted for covariates. Theory of statistical models is well-established if the set of independent variables to consider is fixed and small. Hence, we can assume that effect estimates are unbiased and the usual methods for confidence interval estimation are valid. In routine work, however, it is not known a priori which covariates should be included in a model, and often we are confronted with the number of candidate variables in the range 10\textendash 30. This number is often too large to be considered in a statistical model. We provide an overview of various available variable selection methods that are based on significance or information criteria, penalized likelihood, the change-in-estimate criterion, background knowledge, or combinations thereof. These methods were usually developed in the context of a linear regression model and then transferred to more generalized linear models or models for censored survival data. Variable selection, in particular if used in explanatory modeling where effect estimates are of central interest, can compromise stability of a final model, unbiasedness of regression coefficients, and validity of p-values or confidence intervals. Therefore, we give pragmatic recommendations for the practicing statistician on application of variable selection methods in general (low-dimensional) modeling problems and on performing stability investigations and inference. We also propose some quantities based on resampling the entire variable selection process to be routinely reported by software packages offering automated variable selection algorithms.},

Data on 3-year mortality and the predictors of age, dyspnea, and airflow obstruction were available. We simulated missing data by omitting the predictor dyspnea cohort-wide, and we present 6 methods for handling the missing variable. We assessed model performance with regard to discriminative ability and calibration and by using 2 vignette scenarios. We showed that the use of any imputation method outperforms the omission of the cohort from the validation, which is a commonly used approach. Compared with using the full data set without the missing variable (benchmark), multiple imputation with fixed or random intercepts for cohorts was the best approach to impute the systematically missing predictor. Findings of this study may facilitate the use of cohort studies that do not include all predictors and pave the way for more widespread external validation of prediction models even if 1 or more predictors of the model are systematically missing.},

It was intensively used in the French West Indies until 1993 to control the banana root borer. Because of the long-term contamination of soils and water, the population is currently exposed to chlordecone through food consumption. Chlordecone has been found in the blood of pregnant women and in cord blood. It has been shown to be an endocrine-disrupting chemical and exposure during pregnancy may affect fetal growth. Objectives The objective of our study was to examine the association between prenatal exposure to chlordecone and fetal growth based on the TIMOUN birth cohort conducted in Guadeloupe, with a focus on the potential modification of this relationship by maternal body mass index (BMI) and gestational weight gain (GWG). Methods Chlordecone was determined in cord plasma at birth in 593 babies. Birth weight was the indicator of fetal growth. Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and GWG were determined. Adherence to GWG recommendations of the US Institute of Medicine based on maternal pre-pregnancy BMI was assessed. Birth weight was analyzed relative to cord blood chlordecone levels using linear and non-linear regression models. Results Overall chlordecone in cord blood was not associated with birth weight, but we found an interaction between chlordecone exposure with GWG and adherence to GWG recommendations. After stratification by GWG, we found a significant U-shaped association between birth weight and chlordecone exposure, within the upper quartiles of GWG or excessive GWG. Conclusion Chlordecone exposure may affect fetal growth, particularly when excessive GWG is present.},

Here, we investigate the consequences of reduced adipose tissue (AT) Repin1 expression in vivo. SUBJECTS/METHODS: We have inactivated the Repin1 gene in adipose tissue (iARep-/-) at an age of 4 weeks using tamoxifen-inducible gene targeting strategies on the background of C57BL/6NTac mice. Furthermore, we differentiated human primary adipocytes derived from subcutaneous AT in vitro and knocked down REPIN1 using siRNA technique to measure glycerol release. RESULTS: Conditional Repin1 inactivation results in decreased AT mass, smaller adipocytes in both, subcutaneous and epigonadal AT compared to controls. Compared to controls, iARep-/- mice were more insulin sensitive, had better glucose tolerance and lower LDL-, HDL- and total cholesterol. Significantly lower AT expression of the Repin1 target genes Cd36 and Lcn2 may contribute to the phenotype of iARep-/- mice. Knockdown of REPIN1 in human in vitro differentiated adipocytes revealed an increased glycerol release. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, deficiency of Repin1 in AT causes alterations in AT morphology and function, which may underlay lower body weight and improved parameters of insulin sensitivity, glucose and lipid metabolism.},

Abnormal expression of imprinted genes is implicated in imprinting disorders and tumors. In colorectal cancer (CRC), methylation and imprinting status of the IGF2/H19 domain have been studied. However, no comprehensive methylation analysis of iDMRs in CRC has been reported. Furthermore, the relationship between iDMR methylation status and other methylation-related issues, such as CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) and long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1) methylation, remains unclear. Results We analyzed the methylation status of 38 iDMRs in 106 CRC patients. We also investigated CIMP, LINE-1 methylation, KRAS and BRAF gene mutations, and loss of imprinting (LOI) of IGF2. We further examined the relationship between these factors and clinicopathological factors. The overall trend in iDMR methylation was towards hypermethylation, and iDMRs could be grouped into three categories: susceptible, resistant, and intermediate-to-aberrant methylation. The susceptible and resistant iDMRs consisted of all types of iDMR (gametic and somatic, maternally and paternally methylated). Hypermethylation of multiple iDMRs (HyMiD)-positive status was statistically associated with CIMP-positive status, but not associated with mutations in the BRAF and KRAS genes. HyMiD-positive status was inversely associated with LINE-1 methylation. Among four iDMRs within the IGF2/H19 domain, IGF2-DMR0 hypomethylation occurred most frequently, but was not associated with IGF2 LOI. Finally, we statistically calculated predictive prognostic scores based on aberrant methylation status of three iDMRs. Conclusion In CRC tissues, some iDMRs were susceptible to hypermethylation independent of the type of iDMR and genomic sequence. Although HyMiD-positive status was associated with CIMP-positive status, this was independent of the BRAF and KRAS pathways, which are responsible for CIMP. Since IGF2-DMR0 hypomethylation and aberrant methylation of other iDMRs within the IGF2/H19 domain were not associated with IGF2 LOI, dysfunction of any of the molecular components related to imprinting regulation may be involved in IGF2 LOI. The prognostic score calculated based on aberrant methylation of three iDMRs has potential clinical applications as a prognostic predictor in patients. Further study is required to understand the biological significance of, and mechanisms behind, aberrant methylation of iDMRs and IGF2 LOI in CRCs.

This extent may be measured by estimating a between-study variance, but interpretation is then speci\"yc to a particular treatment e ect metric. A test for the existence of heterogeneity exists, but depends on the number of studies in the meta-analysis. We develop measures of the impact of heterogeneity on a meta-analysis, from mathematical criteria, that are independent of the number of studies and the treatment e ect metric. We derive and propose three suitable statistics: H is the square root of the 2 heterogeneity statistic divided by its degrees of freedom; R is the ratio of the standard error of the underlying mean from a random e ects meta-analysis to the standard error of a \"yxed e ect meta-analytic estimate, and I 2 is a transformation of H that describes the proportion of total variation in study estimates that is due to heterogeneity. We discuss interpretation, interval estimates and other properties of these measures and examine them in \"yve example data sets showing di erent amounts of heterogeneity. We conclude that H and I 2, which can usually be calculated for published meta-analyses, are particularly useful summaries of the impact of heterogeneity. One or both should be presented in published meta-analyses in preference to the test for heterogeneity. Copyright ? 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Changes in placental function have been observed with many antenatal conditions that are risk factors for preterm birth and/or poor neurodevelopment including fetal growth restriction and in-utero inflammation. This review will highlight placental factors that have been studied to understand the underlying mechanisms and identify biomarkers that lead to poor child neurodevelopmental outcomes. These include changes in gross morphological and histopathological structure and the placental inflammatory response to prenatal infection. Further, we will describe the placenta's role as both a barrier to maternally-derived bioactive substances critical for normal fetal brain development, such as cortisol, and a source of neuroactive steroids and neurotrophins known to have critical functions in neuronal proliferation, axonal growth, myelination and the regulation of apoptosis. Finally, emerging data supporting the potential utility of novel placental biomarkers in the early prediction of poor neurodevelopmental outcome in infants born both preterm and term will be discussed. These include the assessment of genetic variants (e.g. single nucleotide polymorphisms in placental tissue) and epigenetic biomarkers (e.g. placental microRNAs and placental DNA methylation). With the placenta the key tissue regulating the fetal environment, integration of observed changes in placental function with genetic and epigenetic variations may advance our ability to predict future infant health. Ultimately, this may facilitate targeted allocation of health resources with the aim of improving lifelong neurodevelopmental capability.},

PFC exposures have been linked to various health impacts, and data in animals suggest that PFCs may be potential developmental neurotoxicants. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the associations between exposures to four PFCs and parental report of diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHODS: Data were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2000 and 2003-2004 for children 12-15 years of age. Parental report of a previous diagnosis by a doctor or health care professional of ADHD in the child was the primary outcome measure. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) levels were measured in serum samples from each child. RESULTS: Parents reported that 48 of 571 children included in the analysis had been diagnosed with ADHD. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for parentally reported ADHD in association with a 1-{$\mu$}g/L increase in serum PFOS (modeled as a continuous predictor) was 1.03 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-1.05]. Adjusted ORs for 1-{$\mu$}g/L increases in PFOA and PFHxS were also statistically significant (PFOA: OR = 1.12; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.23; PFHxS: OR = 1.06; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.11), and we observed a nonsignificant positive association with PFNA (OR = 1.32; 95\% CI, 0.86-2.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our results, using cross-sectional data, are consistent with increased odds of ADHD in children with higher serum PFC levels. Given the extremely prevalent exposure to PFCs, follow-up of these data with cohort studies is needed.},

Previous studies used epigenetic data sets associated with the germline transmission of epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and novel ML approaches to predict genome-wide locations of critical epimutations. A combination of Active Learning (ACL) and Imbalanced Class Learning (ICL) was used to address past problems with ML to develop a more efficient feature selection process and address the imbalance problem in all genomic data sets. The power of this novel ML approach and our ability to predict epigenetic phenomena and associated disease is suggested. The current approach requires extensive computation of features over the genome. A promising new approach is to introduce Deep Learning (DL) for the generation and simultaneous computation of novel genomic features tuned to the classification task. This approach can be used with any genomic or biological data set applied to medicine. The application of molecular epigenetic data in advanced machine learning analysis to medicine is the focus of this review.},

Using mice deficient in the Irf7 gene (Irf7-/- mice), we show that the transcription factor IRF-7 is essential for the induction of IFN-alpha/beta genes via the virus-activated, MyD88-independent pathway and the TLR-activated, MyD88-dependent pathway. Viral induction of MyD88-independent IFN-alpha/beta genes is severely impaired in Irf7-/- fibroblasts. Consistently, Irf7-/- mice are more vulnerable than Myd88-/- mice to viral infection, and this correlates with a marked decrease in serum IFN levels, indicating the importance of the IRF-7-dependent induction of systemic IFN responses for innate antiviral immunity. Furthermore, robust induction of IFN production by activation of the TLR9 subfamily in plasmacytoid dendritic cells is entirely dependent on IRF-7, and this MyD88-IRF-7 pathway governs the induction of CD8+ T-cell responses. Thus, all elements of IFN responses, whether the systemic production of IFN in innate immunity or the local action of IFN from plasmacytoid dendritic cells in adaptive immunity, are under the control of IRF-7.},

However, measurements obtained from these arrays may be affected by technical artefacts that result in spurious associations if left unchecked. Cross-reactivity represents one of the major challenges, meaning that probes may map to multiple regions in the genome. Although several studies have reported on this issue, few studies have empirically examined the impact of cross-reactivity in an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS). In this paper, we report on cross-reactivity issues that we discovered in a large EWAS on the presence of the C9orf72 repeat expansion in ALS patients. Specifically, we found that that the majority of the significant probes inadvertently cross-hybridized to the C9orf72 locus. Importantly, these probes were not flagged as cross-reactive in previous studies, leading to novel insights into the extent to which cross-reactivity can impact EWAS. Our findings are particularly relevant for epigenetic studies into diseases associated with repeat expansions and other types of structural variation. More generally however, considering that most spurious associations were not excluded based on pre-defined sets of cross-reactive probes, we believe that the presented data-driven flag and consider approach is relevant for any type of EWAS.},

Objective: To examine associations between dentine biomarkers of manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn) and lead (Pb) and later childhood behaviors. Methods: Subjects enrolled in a longitudinal birth cohort study in Mexico City provided naturally shed deciduous teeth. We estimated weekly prenatal and postnatal dentine Mn, Zn and Pb concentrations in teeth using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and measured behavior at ages 8\textendash 11 years of age using the Behavior Assessment System for Children, 2nd edition (BASC-2). We used distributed lag models and lagged weighted quantile sum regression to identify the role of individual and combined dentine biomarkers of Mn, Zn and Pb on behavioral outcomes controlling for maternal education and gestational age. Results: Among the 133 subjects included in this study, prenatal and early postnatal dentine Mn appeared protective against childhood behavioral problems, specifically hyperactivity and attention. Postnatal dentine Mn was associated with increased reporting of internalizing problems, specifically anxiety. At 6 months, a 1-unit increase (unit = 1 SD of log concentration) in Mn was associated with a 0.18-unit (unit = 1 SD of BASC-2 score) increase in internalizing symptoms score and a 0.25-unit increase in anxiety. Postnatal Pb was associated with increasing anxiety symptoms; at 12 months, a 1-unit increase in Pb was associated with a 0.4 unit increase in anxiety symptoms. When examined as a metal mixture, we observed two potential windows of susceptibility to increased anxiety symptoms: the first window (0\textendash 8 months) appeared driven by Mn, the second window (8\textendash 12 months) was driven by the metal mixture and dominated by Pb. A 1-unit increase in the mixture index was associated with a 0.7-unit increase in SD of anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: Childhood behaviors may demonstrate postnatal windows of susceptibility to individual and mixed metal concentrations measured in deciduous teeth. Prenatal dentine Mn may be protective, while excessive early postnatal Mn may increase risk for adverse behaviors. In combination, higher concentrations of Mn, Zn and Pb may have an adverse impact on behavior.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Recently there has been increasing interest in the effects of cell mixture on the measurement of DNA methylation, specifically the extent to which small perturbations in cell mixture proportions can register as changes in DNA methylation. A recently published set of statistical methods exploits this association to infer changes in cell mixture proportions, and these methods are presently being applied to adjust for cell mixture effect in the context of epigenome-wide association studies. However, these adjustments require the existence of reference datasets, which may be laborious or expensive to collect. For some tissues such as placenta, saliva, adipose or tumor tissue, the relevant underlying cell types may not be known. RESULTS: We propose a method for conducting epigenome-wide association studies analysis when a reference dataset is unavailable, including a bootstrap method for estimating standard errors. We demonstrate via simulation study and several real data analyses that our proposed method can perform as well as or better than methods that make explicit use of reference datasets. In particular, it may adjust for detailed cell type differences that may be unavailable even in existing reference datasets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Software is available in the R package RefFreeEWAS. Data for three of four examples were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), accession numbers GSE37008, GSE42861 and GSE30601, while reference data were obtained from GEO accession number GSE39981.

  abstract = {Background: The impact of cell-composition effects in analysis of DNA methylation data is now widely appreciated. With the availability of a reference data set consisting of DNA methylation measurements on isolated cell types, it is possible to impute cell proportions and adjust for them, but there is increasing interest in methods that adjust for cell composition effects when reference sets are incomplete or unavailable. Results: In this article we present a theoretical basis for one such method, showing that the total effect of a phenotype on DNA methylation can be decomposed into orthogonal components, one representing the effect of phenotype on proportions of major cell types, the other representing either subtle effects in composition or global effects at focused loci, and that it is possible to separate these two types of effects in a finite data set. We demonstrate this principle empirically on nine DNA methylation data sets, showing that the first few principal components generally contain a majority of the information on cell-type present in the data, but that later principal components nevertheless contain information about a small number of loci that may represent more focused associations. We also present a new method for determining the number of linear terms to interpret as cell-mixture effects and demonstrate robustness to the choice of this parameter. Conclusions: Taken together, our work demonstrates that reference-free algorithms for cell-mixture adjustment can produce biologically valid results, separating cell-mediated epigenetic effects (i.e. apparent effects arising from differences in cell composition) from those that are not cell mediated, and that in general the interpretation of associations evident from DNA methylation should be carefully considered.},

Over the last fifteen years, stratification-based techniques as well as methods such as inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation have been more prominently discussed and offered as a means to correct for selection bias. However, unlike correcting for confounding bias using inverse weighting, uptake of inverse probability-ofcensoring weighted estimation as well as competing methods has been limited in the applied epidemiologic literature. To motivate greater use of inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation and competing methods, we use causal diagrams to describe the sources of selection bias in cohort studies employing a time-to-event framework when the quantity of interest is an absolute measure (e.g. absolute risk, survival function) or relative effect measure (e.g., risk difference, risk ratio). We highlight that whether a given estimate obtained from standard methods is potentially subject to selection bias depends on the causal diagram and the measure. We first broadly describe inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation and then give a simple example to demonstrate in detail how inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation mitigates selection bias and describe challenges to estimation. We then modify complex, realworld data from the University of North Carolina Center for AIDS Research HIV clinical cohort study and estimate the absolute and relative change in the occurrence of death with and without inverse probability-of-censoring weighted correction using the modified University of North Carolina data. We provide SAS code to aid with implementation of inverse probability-ofcensoring weighted techniques.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In animal studies, perfluorinated alkyl substances affect growth and neuro-behavioural outcomes. Human epidemiological studies are sparse. The aim was to investigate the association between pregnancy serum concentrations of perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and offspring behaviour and motor development at 5-9 years of age. METHODS: Maternal sera from the INUENDO cohort (2002-2004) comprising 1,106 mother-child pairs from Greenland, Kharkiv (Ukraine) and Warsaw (Poland) were analysed for PFOS and PFOA, using liquid-chromatography-tandem-mass-spectrometry. Exposures were grouped into country specific as well as pooled tertiles as well as being used as continuous variables for statistical analyses. Child motor development and behaviour at follow-up (2010-2012) were measured by the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire 2007 (DCDQ) and Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), respectively. Exposure-outcome associations were analysed by multiple logistic and linear regression analyses. RESULTS: In the pooled analysis, odds ratio (OR) (95\% confidence interval (CI)) for hyperactivity was 3.1 (1.3, 7.2) comparing children prenatally exposed to the highest PFOA tertile with those exposed to the lowest PFOA tertile. Comparing children in the highest PFOS tertile with those in the lowest PFOS tertile showed elevated but statistically non-significant OR of hyperactivity (OR (95\% CI) 1.7 (0.9, 3.2)). In Greenland, elevated PFOS was associated with higher SDQ-total scores indicating more behavioural problems ({$\beta$} (95\% CI)=1.0 (0.1, 2.0)) and elevated PFOA was associated with higher hyperactivity sub-scale scores indicating more hyperactive behaviour ({$\beta$} (95\% CI)=0.5 (0.1, 0.9)). Prenatal PFOS and PFOA exposures were not associated with motor difficulties. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal exposure to PFOS and PFOA may have a small to moderate effect on children's neuro-behavioural development, specifically in terms of hyperactive behaviour. The associations were strongest in Greenland where exposure contrast is largest.},

We have examined the association between maternal folate and birth weight and assessed the mediating role of DNA methylation at nine differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of genomically imprinted genes in these associations. Compared with newborns of women with folate levels in the lowest quartile, birth weight was higher in newborns of mothers in the second ({$\beta$} = 143.2, se = 63.2, P = 0.02), third ({$\beta$} = 117.3, se = 64.0, P = 0.07), and fourth ({$\beta$} = 133.9, se = 65.2, P = 0.04) quartiles, consistent with a threshold effect. This pattern of association did not vary by race/ethnicity but was more apparent in newborns of non-obese women. DNA methylation at the PLAGL1, SGCE, DLK1/MEG3 and IGF2/H19 DMRs was associated with maternal folate levels and also birth weight, suggestive of threshold effects. MEG3 DMR methylation mediated the association between maternal folate levels and birth weight (P =0.06). While the small sample size and partial scope of examined DMRs limit our conclusions, our data suggest that, with respect to birth weight, no additional benefits may be derived from increased maternal folate concentrations, especially in non-obese women. These data also support epigenetic plasticity as a key mechanistic response to folate availability during early fetal development.},

A first proposal uses the k-nearest neighbor procedure based on the Aitchison distance, a distance measure especially designed for compositional data. It is important to adjust the estimated missing values to the overall size of the compositional parts of the neighbors. As a second proposal an iterative model-based imputation technique is introduced which initially starts from the result of the proposed k-nearest neighbor procedure. The method is based on iterative regressions, thereby accounting for the whole multivariate data information. The regressions have to be performed in a transformed space, and depending on the data quality classical or robust regression techniques can be employed. The proposed methods are tested on a real and on simulated data sets. The results show that the proposed methods outperform standard imputation methods. In the presence of outliers, the model-based method with robust regressions is preferable.},

The relationship of EDC mixtures with infant birth weight, however, remains poorly understood. We examined the relations between prenatal exposure to EDC mixtures and infant birth weight. Methods: We used data from the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) Study, a panCanadian cohort of 1857 pregnant women enrolled between 2008 and 2011. We quantified twenty-one chem\- ical concentrations from five EDC classes, including organochlorine compounds (OCs), metals, perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), phenols and phthalate metabolites that were detected in {$>$}70\% of urine or blood samples collected during the first trimester. In our primary analysis, we used Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) models to assess variable importance, explore EDC mixture effects, and identify any interactions among EDCs. Our secondary analysis used traditional linear regression to compare the results with those of BKMR and to quantify the changes in mean birth weight in relation to prenatal EDC exposures. Results: We found evidence that mixtures of OCs and metals were associated with monotonic decreases in mean birth weight across the whole range of exposure. trans-Nonachlor from the OC mixture and lead (Pb) from the metal mixture had the greatest impact on birth weight. Our linear regression analysis corroborated the BKMR results and found that a 2-fold increase in trans-nonachlor and Pb concentrations reduced mean birth weight by - 38 g (95\% confidence interval (CI): - 67, - 10) and - 39 g (95\% CI: - 69, - 9), respectively. A sex-specific association for OC mixture was observed among female infants. PFAS, phenols and phthalates were not asso\- ciated with birth weight. No interactions were observed among the EDCs. Conclusions: Using BKMR, we observed that both OC and metal mixtures were associated with decreased birth weight in the MIREC Study. trans-Nonachlor from the OC mixture and Pb from the metal mixture contributed most to the adverse effects.},

Maternal urinary TCS level has been associated with changes in birth weight of infants. We in the present study investigated whether exposure of mice to 8~mg/kg TCS from gestational day (GD) 6 to GD14 alters prenatal and postnatal growth and development, and metabolic phenotypes in male and female offspring (TCS-offspring). Compared with control offspring, body weight in postnatal day (PND) 1 male or female TCS-offspring was reduced, but body weight gain was faster within postnatal 5 days. PND30 and PND60 TCS-offspring showed overweight with increases in visceral fat and adipocyte size. PND60 TCS-offspring displayed delayed glucose clearance and insulin resistance. PND30 TCS-offspring showed an increase in food intake without the changes in the oxygen consumption and respiratory exchange ratio (RER). The expression levels of proopiomelanocortin (POMC), {$\alpha$}-melanocyte-stimulating hormone ({$\alpha$}-MSH) and single-minded 1 (SIM1) in hypothalamus arcuate nucleus (ARC) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN), respectively, were significantly reduced in PND30 TCS-offspring compared to controls. The hypermethylation of CpG sites at the POMC promoter was observed in PND30 TCS-offspring, while the concentration of serum leptin was elevated and the level of STAT3 phosphorylation in ARC had no significant difference from control. This study demonstrates that TCS exposure during early/mid-gestation through the hypermethylation of the POMC promoter reduces the expression of anorexigenic neuropeptides to cause the postnatal hyperphagic obesity, leading to metabolic syndrome in adulthood.},

The aims of this study were to evaluate the association between maternal urine excretion, the exposure of fetus to phthalates in amniotic fluid, and the health of newborns. Amniotic fluid and urine samples from pregnant women were collected to measure five phthalate monoesters using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) and the newborns' birth weight, gestational age, and anogenital distance (AGD) were collected. The median levels of three phthalate monoesters in urine and amniotic fluid were 78.4 and 85.2 ng/mL monobutyl phthalate (MBP); 24.9 and 22.8 ng/mL mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP); 19.8 and Not Detected monoethyl phthalate (MEP). We found a significant positive correlation only between creatinine adjusted urinary MBP and amniotic fluid MBP (R(2)=0.156, p{$<$}0.05) in all infants and, only in female infants, a significantly negative correlation between amniotic fluid MBP, AGD (R=-0.31, p{$<$}0.06), and the anogenital index adjusted by birth weight (AGI-W) (R=-0.32, p{$<$}0.05). Although the influence of prenatal di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) exposure on the endocrinology and physiology of the fetus is still a puzzle, our data clearly show that in utero exposure to phthalates in general has anti-androgenic effects on the fetus.},

The exploration of extreme value events requires the use of heavy-tailed distributions to build a model which fits the data well. One needs to estimate high conditional quantiles of a random variable for extreme events. Quantile regression ultimately yields results which the alternative mean regression method has no hope to offer, leading to it being labeled as the more powerful method. In order to improve this approach even further, a weighted quantile regression method is introduced with a complete comparison to the unweighted method. The Monte Carlo simulations show good results for the proposed weighted method. Comparisons of the proposed method and existing methods are given. The paper also investigates two real-world examples of applications on extreme events using the proposed weighted method.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epigenetic mechanisms, such as altered DNA methylation, may participate in the relationship between prenatal phthalate exposure and adverse birth outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To explore the mediation effect of DNA methylation in the associations of phthalate exposure before delivery with birth outcomes in a Chinese cohort. METHODS: Eight phthalate metabolites in maternal urine before delivery and DNA methylation of Alu and long interspersed nucleotide elements (LINE-1) in cord blood were determined among 106 mother-infant pairs. General additive models were used to assess the associations of maternal urinary phthalate metabolites with birth outcomes and DNA methylation; the mediating role of DNA methylation in cord blood was evaluated by mediation analysis. RESULTS: We found sex-specific associations between prenatal phthalate exposure and birth outcomes and DNA methylation of cord blood. For example, the molar sum of di-2-(ethylhexyl) phthalate ({$\sum$}DEHPm) metabolites in maternal urine was positively associated with gestational age among male newborns only (P {$<$} 0.05); maternal urinary monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) was negatively associated with Alu methylation among female newborns only (P {$<$} 0.05). Mediation analysis did not find that methylation of Alu and LINE-1 to be a direct mediator in the relationships between maternal urinary phthalate metabolites before delivery and birth outcomes. CONCLUSION: Prenatal exposure to certain phthalates was associated with altered birth outcomes and decreased repetitive element methylation of newborns. However, the altered birth outcomes exerted by prenatal phthalate exposure does not seem to be directly mediated through repetitive element methylation in cord blood.},

This study aimed to investigate the effects of maternal BPA exposure on maternal and fetal DNA methylation levels and explore whether epigenetic changes are related to the associations between BPA and low birth weight. We collected urine and blood samples originating from 162 mother-infant pairs in a Taiwanese cohort study. We measured DNA methylation using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450 BeadChip in 34 maternal blood samples with high and low BPA levels based on the 75th percentile level (9.5 \textmu g/g creatinine). Eighty-seven CpGs with the most differentially methylated probes possibly interacting with BPA exposure or birth weight were selected using two multiple regression models. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was utilized to narrow down 18 candidate CpGs related to disease categories, including developmental disorders, skeletal and muscular disorders, skeletal and muscular system development, metabolic diseases, and lipid metabolism. We then validated these genes by pyrosequencing, and 8 CpGs met the primer design score requirements in 82 cord blood samples. The associations among low birth weight, BPA exposure, and DNA methylation were analyzed. Exposure to BPA was associated with low birth weight. Analysis of the epigenome-wide findings did not show significant associations between BPA and DNA methylation in cord blood of the 8 CpGs. However, the adjusted odds ratio for the dehydrogenase/reductase member 9 (DHRS9) gene, at the 2nd CG site, in the hypermethylated group was significantly associated with low birth weight. These results support a role of BPA, and possibly DHRS9 methylation, in fetal growth. However, additional studies with larger sample sizes are warranted.},

Methylation of Alu and long interspersed nucleotide elements (LINE-1) is a well-established measure of DNA methylation often used in epidemiologic studies. Yet, few studies have examined the effects of host factors on LINE-1 and Alu methylation in children., We characterized the relationship of age, sex, and prenatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs), dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane (DDT), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), with DNA methylation in a birth cohort of Mexican-American children participating in the CHAMACOS study., We measured Alu and LINE-1 methylation by pyrosequencing bisulfite-treated DNA isolated from whole blood samples collected from newborns and 9-year old children (n=358). POPs were measured in maternal serum during late pregnancy., Levels of DNA methylation were lower in 9-year olds compared to newborns and were higher in boys compared to girls. Higher prenatal DDT/E exposure was associated with lower Alu methylation at birth, particularly after adjusting for cell type composition (p=0.02 for o,p{${'}$} -DDT). Associations of POPs with LINE-1 methylation were only identified after examining the co-exposure of DDT/E with PBDEs simultaneously., Our data suggest that repeat element methylation can be an informative marker of epigenetic differences by age and sex and that prenatal exposure to POPs may be linked to hypomethylation in fetal blood. Accounting for co-exposure to different types of chemicals and adjusting for blood cell types may increase sensitivity of epigenetic analyses for epidemiological studies.},

  abstract = {Phthalates are frequently used in personal care products and plasticizers and phthalate exposure is ubiquitous in the US population. Exposure to phthalates during critical periods in utero has been associated with a variety of adverse health outcomes but the biological mechanisms linking these exposures with disease are not well characterized. In this study, we examined the relationship of in utero phthalate exposure with repetitive element DNA methylation, an epigenetic marker of genome instability, in children from the longitudinal birth cohort CHAMACOS. Methylation of Alu and long interspersed nucleotide elements (LINE-1) was determined using pyrosequencing of bisulfite-treated DNA isolated from whole blood samples collected from newborns and 9 year old children (n=355). Concentrations of eleven phthalate metabolites were measured in urine collected from pregnant mothers at 13 and 26 weeks gestation. We found a consistent inverse association between prenatal concentrations of monoethyl phthalate, the most frequently detected urinary metabolite, with cord blood methylation of Alu repeats ({$\beta$}(95\%CI): -0.14 (-0.28,0.00) and -0.16 (-0.31, -0.02)) for early and late pregnancy, respectively, and a similar but weaker association with LINE-1 methylation. Additionally, increases in urinary concentrations of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolites during late pregnancy were associated with lower levels of methylation of Alu repeats in 9 year old blood (significant p-values ranged from 0.003 to 0.03). Our findings suggest that prenatal exposure to some phthalates may influence differences in repetitive element methylation, highlighting epigenetics as a plausible biological mechanism through which phthalates may affect health.},

  abstract = {Environmental factors contribute to the risk for adverse health outcomes against a background of genetic predisposition. Among these factors, chemical exposures may substantially contribute to disease risk and adverse outcomes. In fact, epidemiological cohort studies have established associations between exposure against individual chemicals and adverse health effects. Yet, in daily life individuals are exposed to complex mixtures in varying compositions. To capture the totality of environmental exposures the concept of the exposome has been developed. Here, we undertake an overview of major exposome projects, which pioneered the field of exposomics and explored the links between chemical exposure and health outcomes using cohort studies. We seek to reflect their achievements with regard to (i) capturing a comprehensive picture of the environmental chemical exposome, (ii) aggregating internal exposures using chemical and bioanalytical means of detection, and (iii) identifying associations that provide novel options for risk assessment and intervention. Various complementary approaches can be distinguished in addressing relevant exposure routes and it emerges that individual exposure histories may not easily be grouped. The number of chemicals for which human exposure can be detected is substantial and highlights the reality of mixture exposures. Yet, to a large extent it depends on targeted chemical analysis with the specific challenges to capture all relevant exposure routes and assess the chemical concentrations occurring in humans. The currently used approaches imply prior knowledge or hypotheses about relevant exposures. Typically, the number of chemicals considered in exposome projects is counted in dozens\textemdash in contrast to the several thousands of chemicals for which occurrence have been reported in human serum and urine. Furthermore, health outcomes are often still compared to single chemicals only. Moreover, explicit consideration of mixture effects and the interrelations between different outcomes to support causal relationships and identify risk drivers in complex mixtures remain underdeveloped and call for specifically designed exposome-cohort studies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alkylphenols, such as nonylphenol (NP) and 4-octylphenol (4-OP), have the potential to disturb immune system due to their weak estrogen-like activity, an effect with potential serious public health impact due to the worldwide distribution of these substances. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) can secrete large amounts of type I IFNs and are critical in immune regulation. However, there has been limited study about the influence of alkylphenols on the function of pDCs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of alkylphenols on pDC functions in vitro and in vivo and then further explored the involved signaling pathways and epigenetic changes. METHODS: Circulating pDCs from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were treated with alkylphenols with or without CpG stimulation. Alkylphenol-associated cytokine responses, signaling events, histone modifications and viral activity were further examined. In NP-exposed mice, the effect of NP on splenic pDC function and allergic lung inflammation were also assessed. RESULTS: The results showed that NP increased the expression of TNF-{$\alpha$}, but suppressed IL-10 production in the range of physiological doses, concomitant with activation of the MKK3/6-p38 signaling pathway and enhanced levels of acetylated histone 3 as well as histone 4 at the TNFA gene locus. Further, in CpG-stimulated pDCs, NP suppressed type I IFNs production, associated with down-regulation of IRF-7 and MKK1/2-ERK-Elk-1 pathways and led to the impaired anti-enterovirus 71 activity in vitro. Additionally, splenic pDCs from NP-exposed mice showed similar cytokine changes upon CpG stimulation under conditions relevant to route and level of exposure in humans. NP treatment also enhanced allergic lung inflammation in vivo. CONCLUSION: Alkylphenols may influence pDCs' functions via their abilities to induce expression of a pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-{$\alpha$}, and to suppress regulatory cytokines, including IL-10, IFN-{$\alpha$} and IFN-{$\beta$}, suggesting the potential impact of endocrine disrupting chemicals on immune regulation.},

AQP1 mRNA and protein were down-regulated in fibroblasts lacking APP or presenilin 2 in which AQP1 expression was restored by stable expression of full-length APP or presenilin 2 but not by APP deleted from its carboxy-terminal domain. The transcriptional activity of the AQP1 gene promoter and the stability of AQP1 mRNA were identical in fibroblasts expressing or not expressing APP. Control of AQP1 expression by APP was sensitive to trichostatin A, an histone deacetylase inhibitor, and histone deacetylase activity coimmunoprecipitated with APP. Altogether, these data show that a presenilin-2-dependent gamma-secretase activity releases the intracellular domain of APP involved in the epigenetic control of AQP1 expression. Since AQP1 is found in astrocytes surrounding senile plaques, this epigenetic control of AQP1 expression could have important implications in Alzheimer disease.},

  abstract = {Background: Studies suggest that exposure to pesticides during pregnancy and early childhood is associated with adverse child neurodevelopment. Research to date has focused primarily on exposure to single pesticides or pesticide classes in isolation; there are little data on the effect of exposure to pesticide mixtures on child and adolescent neurodevelopment. Methods: Using California's Pesticide Use Reporting database, we estimated agricultural pesticide use within 1 km of the home during the prenatal and postnatal (ages 0\textendash 5 years) periods among participants in the Center for the Health Assessment for Mothers and Children of Salinas (CHAMACOS) birth cohort. We implemented a Bayesian Hierarchical linear mixed-effects model to examine associations with maternal- and youth-reported behavioral and emotional problems from the Behavior Assessment System for Children, 2nd edition (BASC-2) at ages 16 and 18 years (n = 593). Results: We observed mostly null associations between pesticide applications and neurobehavioral outcomes. There were some trends of modestly increased internalizing behaviors and attention problems in association with organophosphate insecticide use near the home during the prenatal period. In the postnatal period, a two-fold increase in glyphosate applications was associated with more youth-reported depression ({$\beta$} = 1.2, 95\% credible intervals [CrI] = 0.2, 2.2), maternal-reported internalizing behaviors ({$\beta$} = 1.23, 95\% CrI = 0.2, 2.3), and anxiety ({$\beta$} = 1.2, 95\% CrI = 0.2, 2.3). We observed some protective associations with imidacloprid during the prenatal period, particularly in sex-specific analyses. Conclusions: We found only some subtle associations between some pesticides and neurobehavioral outcomes. This study extends previous work by considering potential exposure to mixtures of pesticides.},

The committee was asked to address the following tasks: 1. Review evidence on the relationship between weight gain patterns before, during, and after pregnancy and maternal and child health outcomes, with particular attention to the prevalence of maternal obesity racial/ethnic and age differences, components of GWG, and implications of weight during pregnancy on postpartum weight retention, maternal and child obesity, and later child health. 2. Within a life-stage framework consider factors in relation to GWG that are associated with maternal health outcomes such as lactation performance, postpartum weight retention, cardiovascular disease, metabolic processes including glucose and insulin-related issues, and risk of other chronic diseases; for infants and children, in addition to low birth weight, consider early developmental impacts and obesity-related consequences (e.g., mental health, diabetes). 3. Recommend revisions to the existing guidelines, where necessary, including the need for specific pregnancy weight guidelines for underweight, normal weight, and overweight and obese women and adolescents and women carrying twins or higher-order multiples. 4. Consider a range of approaches to promote appropriate weight gain, including: individual (behavior), psychosocial, community, health care, and health systems; timing and components of interventions; and ways to enhance awareness and adoption of the guidelines, including interdisciplinary approaches, consumer education to men and women, strategies to assist practitioners to use the guidelines, and public health strategies. 5.

We examined the effects of bisphenol A, and its derivatives, 3-hydroxybisphenol A and bisphenol A 3,4-quinone on rat behavior as possible metabolites of bisphenol A. A single intracisternal administration of bisphenol A (20 {$\mu$}g equivalent to 87 nmol) into 5-day-old male Wistar rats caused significant hyperactivity at 4-5 weeks of age. It was about 1.3 fold more active in the nocturnal phase than control rats. However, neither 3-hydroxybisphenol A nor bisphenol A 3,4-quinone at the same amount (87 nmol) increased the spontaneous motor activity. Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analyses of the treated brain revealed that 7\% of the parent chemical resided in the brain at 8 weeks of age, but its derivatives were not found. This suggested a difference in metabolic turnover of these compounds or a difference in their stabilities. We conclude that bisphenol A per se caused hyperactivity in the rat, eliminating the possibility that possible metabolic forms of bisphenol A, 3-hydroxybisphenol A and bisphenol A 3,4-quinone have the ability to elicit rat hyperactivity, probably because of longer-lasting residence of the parent compound in the brain.},

  abstract = {Background: Epigenetic modification has an effect on gene expression under the environmental alteration, but it does not change corresponding genome sequence. DNA methylation (DNAm) is one of the important epigenetic mechanisms. DNAm variations could be used as epigenetic markers to predict and account for the change of many human phenotypic traits, such as cancer, diabetes, and high blood pressure. In this study, we built deep neural network (DNN) regression models to account for interindividual variation in triglyceride concentrations measured at different visits of peripheral blood samples using epigenome-wide DNAm profiles. Results: We used epigenome-wide DNAm profiles of before and after medication interventions (called pretreatment and posttreatment, respectively) to predict triglyceride concentrations for peripheral blood draws at visit 2 (using pretreatment data) and at visit 4 (using both pretreatment and posttreatment data). Our experimental results showed that DNN models can predict triglyceride concentrations for blood draws at visit 4 using pretreatment and posttreatment DNAm data more accurately than for blood draws at visit 2 using pretreatment DNAm data. Furthermore, we got the best prediction results when we used pretreatment DNAm data to predict triglyceride concentrations for blood draws at visit 4, which suggests a long-term epigenetic effect on phenotypic traits. We compared the prediction performances of our proposed DNN models with that of support vector machine (SVM). This comparison showed that our DNN models achieved better prediction performance than did SVM. Conclusions: We demonstrated the superiority of our proposed DNN models over the SVM model for predicting triglyceride concentrations. This study also suggests that the DNN approach has advantages over other traditional machine-learning methods to model high-dimensional epigenome-wide DNAm data and other genomic data.},

Of note, many studies, as those published in this Journal, report association of gene(s) at the genomic and transcriptomic levels by undertaking appropriate statistical tests. For instance, genotype, allele or haplotype frequencies at the genomic level or normalized expression levels at the transcriptomic level are compared between the case and control groups using the Chi-square/Fisher's exact test or independent (i.e. two-sampled) t-test respectively, with this culminating into a single numeric, namely the P value (or the degree of the false positive rate), which is used to make or break the outcome of the association test. This approach has flaws but nevertheless remains a standard and convenient approach in association studies. However, what becomes a critical issue is that the same cut-off is used when `multiple' tests are undertaken on the same case-control (or any pairwise) comparison. Here, in brevity, we present what the P value represents, and why and when it should be adjusted. We also show, with worked examples, how to adjust P values for multiple testing in the R environment for statistical computing (http://www.R-project.org).},

  abstract = {Background During the past 5 years, high-throughput technologies have been successfully used by epidemiology studies, but almost all have focused on sequence variation through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Today, the study of other genomic events is becoming more common in large-scale epidemiological studies. Many of these, unlike the single-nucleotide polymorphism studied in GWAS, are continuous measures. In this context, the exercise of searching for regions of interest for disease is akin to the problems described in the statistical `bump hunting' literature. Methods New statistical challenges arise when the measurements are continuous rather than categorical, when they are measured with uncertainty, and when both biological signal, and measurement errors are characterized by spatial correlation along the genome. Perhaps the most challenging complication is that continuous genomic data from large studies are measured throughout long periods, making them susceptible to `batch effects'. An example that combines all three characteristics is genome-wide DNA methylation measurements. Here, we present a data analysis pipeline that effectively models measurement error, removes batch effects, detects regions of interest and attaches statistical uncertainty to identified regions. Results We illustrate the usefulness of our approach by detecting genomic regions of DNA methylation associated with a continuous trait in a well-characterized population of newborns. Additionally, we show that addressing unexplained heterogeneity like batch effects reduces the number of false-positive regions. Conclusions Our framework offers a comprehensive yet flexible approach for identifying genomic regions of biological interest in large epidemiological studies using quantitative high-throughput methods.},

However, blood is a heterogeneous collection of different cell types, each with a very different DNA methylation profile. Results: Using a statistical method that permits estimating the relative proportion of cell types from DNA methylation profiles, we examine data from five previously published studies, and find strong evidence of cell composition change across age in blood. We also demonstrate that, in these studies, cellular composition explains much of the observed variability in DNA methylation. Furthermore, we find high levels of confounding between age-related variability and cellular composition at the CpG level. Conclusions: Our findings underscore the importance of considering cell composition variability in epigenetic studies based on whole blood and other heterogeneous tissue sources. We also provide software for estimating and exploring this composition confounding for the Illumina 450k microarray.},

  abstract = {Epidemiological studies provide evidence that environmental exposures may affect health through complex mixtures. Formal investigation of the effect of exposure mixtures is usually achieved by modelling interactions, which relies on strong assumptions relating to the identity and the number of the exposures involved in such interactions, and on the order and parametric form of these interactions. These hypotheses become difficult to formulate and justify in an exposome context, where influential exposures are numerous and heterogeneous. To capture both the complexity of the exposome and its possibly pleiotropic effects, models handling multivariate predictors and responses, such as partial least squares (PLS) algorithms, can prove useful. As an illustrative example, we applied PLS models to data from a study investigating the inflammatory response (blood concentration of 13 immune markers) to the exposure to four disinfection by-products (one brominated and three chlorinated compounds), while swimming in a pool. To accommodate the multiple observations per participant (n=60; before and after the swim), we adopted a multilevel extension of PLS algorithms, including sparse PLS models shrinking loadings coefficients of unimportant predictors (exposures) and/or responses (protein levels). Despite the strong correlation among co-occurring exposures, our approach identified a subset of exposures (n=3/4) affecting the exhaled levels of 8 (out of 13) immune markers. PLS algorithms can easily scale to high-dimensional exposures and responses, and prove useful for exposome research to identify sparse sets of exposures jointly affecting a set of (selected) biological markers. Our descriptive work may guide these extensions for higher dimensional data.},

  abstract = {Background: Missing data may seriously compromise inferences from randomised clinical trials, especially if missing data are not handled appropriately. The potential bias due to missing data depends on the mechanism causing the data to be missing, and the analytical methods applied to amend the missingness. Therefore, the analysis of trial data with missing values requires careful planning and attention. Methods: The authors had several meetings and discussions considering optimal ways of handling missing data to minimise the bias potential. We also searched PubMed (key words: missing data; randomi*; statistical analysis) and reference lists of known studies for papers (theoretical papers; empirical studies; simulation studies; etc.) on how to deal with missing data when analysing randomised clinical trials. Results: Handling missing data is an important, yet difficult and complex task when analysing results of randomised clinical trials. We consider how to optimise the handling of missing data during the planning stage of a randomised clinical trial and recommend analytical approaches which may prevent bias caused by unavoidable missing data. We consider the strengths and limitations of using of best-worst and worst-best sensitivity analyses, multiple imputation, and full information maximum likelihood. We also present practical flowcharts on how to deal with missing data and an overview of the steps that always need to be considered during the analysis stage of a trial. Conclusions: We present a practical guide and flowcharts describing when and how multiple imputation should be used to handle missing data in randomised clinical.},

Analysis of microarray data is however very complex, requiring sophisticated methods to control for various factors that are inherent to the procedures used. In this article we describe the individual steps of a microarray experiment, highlighting important elements and factors that may affect the processes involved and that influence the interpretation of the results. Additionally, we describe methods that can be used to estimate the influence of these factors, and to control the way in which they affect the expression estimates. A comprehensive understanding of the experimental protocol used in a microarray experiment aids the interpretation of the obtained results. By describing known factors which affect expression estimates this article provides guidelines for appropriate quality control and pre-processing of the data, additionally applicable to other transcriptome analysis methods that utilize similar sample handling protocols.

The estrogenic activity of parabens may cause undesirable health effects and adverse birth outcomes. The objective of the present systematic review was to investigate the association between prenatal exposure to parabens and anthropometric birth outcomes. PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase databases were systematically searched until April 18, 2018. Of 326 records that remained after removing duplicates, 6 original articles were included in the final analysis after excluding irrelevant articles. The included studies indicated that most of the pregnant mothers were exposed to parabens, especially methyl and propyl parabens. However, no definitive association was found between the prenatal urinary concentration of parabens and birth weight or head circumference. In addition, a positive but non-significant association was detected between birth length and maternal exposure to parabens. The present systematic review revealed that assessment of significant associations in current epidemiological studies is impermissible due to methodological limitations and absence of inter-study consistency. Furthermore, because of the complexity of the effect of environmental factors on health, future large-scale studies with proper study design are required to investigate the effect of parabens exposure on birth outcomes.},

  abstract = {The personal care product Triclosan, 5-chloro-2(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)-phenol, is widely used in consumer products as an antibacterial agent and is increasingly found in the environment as a contaminant of sewage sludge and wastewater. This compound has been identified in plasma and urine of people in the United States, Sweden and Australia. Triclosan is known to inhibit sulfonation of phenolic xenobiotics and is structurally related to inhibitors of estrogen sulfotransferase, such as polychlorobiphenylols. In pregnancy, the placenta is an important source of estrogen, which is needed for normal fetal development and successful parturition, and estrogen sulfotransferase is thought to play an important role in regulation of estrogen availability. In this study, we examined the effect of Triclosan on sheep placental cytosolic sulfotransferase activity with 17-beta-estradiol and estrone as substrates. For comparison, we studied the effects of 4-hydroxy-3,3',4',5-tetrachlorobiphenyl and 2'-hydroxytriclocarban on estradiol sulfonation. The apparent Km for placental cytosolic sulfotransferase activity with estradiol as substrate was 0.27{$\pm$}0.06~nM (mean{$\pm$}S.D., n=3 individuals) and with estrone as substrate was 1.86{$\pm$}0.22~nM. Partial substrate inhibition was observed with estradiol at concentrations higher than 10\textendash 20~nM, as is typical of estrogen sulfotransferases (SULT1E1) in other species. Studies of the effect of Triclosan on estrogen sulfotransferase activity were conducted with several concentrations (0.1\textendash 6~nM) of estradiol and with 2~nM estrone. Triclosan was a very potent inhibitor of both estradiol and estrone sulfonation. For estradiol the inhibition was shown to be mixed competitive/uncompetitive, with Kic of 0.09{$\pm$}0.01~nM and Kiu of 5.2{$\pm$}2.9~nM. The IC50 for inhibition of estrone sulfonation was 0.60{$\pm$}0.06~nM. At an environmentally relevant concentration of 1~\textmu M, Triclosan was not a substrate for glucuronidation in sheep placental microsomes. Triclosan could be sulfonated in placental cytosol with Km 1.14{$\pm$}0.18~\textmu M and Vmax 160{$\pm$}26~pmol/min/mg protein, however the calculated rates of Triclosan sulfonation were negligible at the low nM concentrations that potently inhibit estrogen sulfonation. The high potency of Triclosan as an inhibitor of estrogen sulfotransferase activity raises concern about its possible effects on the ability of the placenta to supply estrogen to the fetus, and in turn on fetal growth and development.},

  abstract = {Background There is evidence that altered DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism in prenatal programming and that developmental periods are sensitive to environmental stressors. We hypothesized that exposure to fine particles (PM2.5) during pregnancy could influence DNA methylation patterns of the placenta. Methods In the ENVIRONAGE birth cohort, levels of 5'-methyl-deoxycytidine (5-mdC) and deoxycytidine (dC) were quantified in placental DNA from 240 newborns. Multiple regression models were used to study placental global DNA methylation and in utero exposure to PM2.5 over various time windows during pregnancy. Results PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy averaged (25th-75th percentile) 17.4 (15.4-19.3) {$\mu$}g/m3. Placental global DNA methylation was inversely associated with PM2.5 exposures during whole pregnancy and relatively decreased by 2.19\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: -3.65, -0.73\%, p\,=\,0.004) for each 5~{$\mu$}g/m3 increase in exposure to PM2.5. In a multi-lag model in which all three trimester exposures were fitted as independent variables in the same regression model, only exposure to PM2.5 during trimester 1 was significantly associated with lower global DNA methylation (-2.13\% per 5~{$\mu$}g/m3 increase, 95\% CI: -3.71, -0.54\%, p\,=\,0.009). When we analyzed shorter time windows of exposure within trimester 1, we observed a lower placental DNA methylation at birth during all implantation stages but exposure during the implantation range (6-21d) was strongest associated (-1.08\% per 5~{$\mu$}g/m3 increase, 95\% CI: -1.80, -0.36\%, p\,=\,0.004). Conclusions We observed a lower degree of placental global DNA methylation in association with exposure to particulate air pollution in early pregnancy, including the critical stages of implantation. Future studies should elucidate genome-wide and gene-specific methylation patterns in placental tissue that could link particulate exposure during in utero life and early epigenetic modulations.},

  abstract = {Imprinted genes, which are monoallelically expressed by virtue of an epigenetic process initiated in the germline, are known to play key roles in regulating fetal growth and placental development. Numerous studies are investigating the expression of these imprinted genes in the human placenta in relation to common complications of pregnancy such as fetal growth restriction and preeclampsia. This study aimed to determine whether placental sampling protocols or other factors such as fetal sex, gestational age and mode of delivery may influence the expression of imprinted genes predicted to regulate placental signalling. METHODS: Term placentas were collected from Caucasian women delivering at University Hospital of Wales or Royal Gwent Hospital within two hours of delivery. Expression of the imprinted genes PHLDA2, CDKN1C, PEG3 and PEG10 was assayed by quantitative real time PCR. Intraplacental gene expression was analysed (N = 5). Placental gene expression was compared between male (N = 11) and female (N = 11) infants, early term (N = 8) and late term (N = 10) deliveries and between labouring (N = 13) and non-labouring (N = 21) participants. RESULTS: The paternally expressed imprinted genes PEG3 and PEG10 were resilient to differences in sampling site, fetal sex, term gestational age and mode of delivery. The maternally expressed imprinted gene CDKN1C was elevated over 2-fold (p {$<$} 0.001) in placenta from labouring deliveries compared with elective caesarean sections. In addition, the maternally expressed imprinted gene PHLDA2 was elevated by 1.8 fold (p = 0.01) in samples taken at the distal edge of the placenta compared to the cord insertion site. CONCLUSION: These findings support the reinterpretation of existing data sets on these genes in relation to complications of pregnancy and further reinforce the importance of optimising and unifying placental collection protocols for future studies.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Epigenetic mechanisms, often defined as regulating gene activity independently of underlying DNA sequence, are crucial for healthy development. The sum total of epigenetic marks within a cell or tissue (the epigenome) is sensitive to environmental influence, and disruption of the epigenome in utero has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Not surprisingly, given its multifaceted functions and important role in regulating pregnancy outcome, the placenta shows unique epigenetic features. Interestingly however, many of these are only otherwise seen in human malignancy (the pseudomalignant placental epigenome). Epigenetic variation in the placenta is now emerging as a candidate mediator of environmental influence on placental functioning and a key regulator of pregnancy outcome. However, replication of findings is generally lacking, most likely due to small sample sizes and a lack of standardization of analytical approaches. Defining DNA methylation "signatures" in the placenta associated with maternal and fetal outcomes offers tremendous potential to improve pregnancy outcomes, but care must be taken in interpretation of findings. Future placental epigenetic research would do well to address the issues present in epigenetic epidemiology more generally, including careful consideration of sample size, potentially confounding factors, issues of tissue heterogeneity, reverse causation, and the role of genetics in modulating epigenetic profile. The importance of animal or in vitro models in establishing a functional role of epigenetic variation identified in human beings, which is key to establishing causation, should not be underestimated.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In our studies, we employed cyclin D2 gene knockout (cD2 KO) mice showing impaired neurogenesis as well as decreased hippocampal size. However, irrespectively of the genetic background of cD2 KO mice, this phenotype resulted in neither deficits in the hippocampal-dependent learning ability nor the memory formation. In the present study, cD2 KO mice and control littermates were subjected to hippocampal-dependent behavioral tests with little or no learning component. The knockout mice showed significant impairment in such species-typical behaviors as nest construction, digging, and marble burying. They were building none or poorer nests, digging less robustly, and burying fewer marbles than control mice. Such impairments were previously described, e.g., in animals with hippocampal lesions. Moreover, cD2 KO animals were also more active in the open field and automated motility chamber as well as showed increased explorative behavior in IntelliCage. Both increased motility and explorative behaviors were previously observed in hippocampally lesioned animals. Finally, cD2 KO mice showed normal sucrose preference, however starting from the second exposure to the sweetened solution, while control animals displayed a strong preference immediately. Presented results suggest that either morphological abnormalities of the hippocampal formation or adult brain neurogenesis impairment (or both) alter hippocampal-dependent behaviors of mutant mice without influencing learning abilities. These results may also suggest that adult brain neurogenesis is involved in species-typical behaviors.},

One states that the illness results from decreased neurogenesis while the other claims that the very functioning of antidepressants depends on increased neurogenesis. In order to verify the latter, we have used cyclin D2 knockout mice (cD2 KO mice), known to have virtually no adult brain neurogenesis, and we demonstrate that these mice successfully respond to chronic fluoxetine. After unpredictable chronic mild stress, mutant mice showed depression-like behavior in forced swim test, which was eliminated with chronic fluoxetine treatment, despite its lack of impact on adult hippocampal neurogenesis in cD2 KO mice. Our results suggest that new neurons are not indispensable for the action of antidepressants such as fluoxetine. Using forced swim test and tail suspension test, we also did not observe depression-like behavior in control cD2 KO mice, which argues against the link between decreased adult brain neurogenesis and major depression. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to the high cell penetration capacity, it was used as a vector for protein, peptide and drug delivery. Two receptors are known to be involved in the endocytic dodecahedron uptake, namely {$\alpha$}v integrins and heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Since it has been observed, that dodecahedron efficiently penetrates a wide range of cancer cells, it suggests that other cellular compounds may play a role in the particle endocytosis. To shed some light onto the interactions with membrane lipids and their potential role in dodecahedron entry, we performed a series of experiments including biochemical assays, fluorescence confocal imaging of giant unilamellar vesicles and surface plasmon resonance, which indicated specific preference of the particle to anionic phosphatidylserine.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies looking at associations between environmental chemicals and child behaviour usually consider only one exposure or family of exposures. OBJECTIVE: This study explores associations between prenatal exposure to a wide range of environmental chemicals and child behaviour. METHODS: We studied 708 mother-child pairs from five European cohorts recruited in 2003-2009. We assessed 47 exposure biomarkers from eight chemical exposure families in maternal blood or urine collected during pregnancy. We used the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) to evaluate child behaviour between three and seven years of age. We assessed associations of SDQ scores with exposures using an adjusted least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) considering all exposures simultaneously and an adjusted exposome-wide association study (ExWAS) considering each exposure independently. RESULTS: LASSO selected only copper (Cu) as associated with externalizing behaviour. In the ExWAS, bisphenol A [BPA, incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.06, 95\% confidence interval (95\%CI): 1.01;1.12] and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP, IRR: 1.06, 95\%CI: 1.00;1.13) were associated with greater risk of externalizing behaviour problems. Cu (IRR: 0.90, 95\%CI: 0.82;0.98), perfluoroundecanoate (PFUnDA, IRR: 0.92, 95\%CI: 0.84;0.99) and organochlorine compounds (OCs) were associated with lower risk of externalizing behaviour problems, however the associations with OCs were mainly seen among women with insufficient weight gain during pregnancy. Internalizing score worsen in association with exposure to diethyl thiophosphate (DETP, IRR: 1.11, 95\%CI: 1.00;1.24) but the effect was driven by the smallest cohort. Internalizing score improved with increased concentration of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS, IRR: 0.92, 95\%CI: 0.85;1.00), however the association was driven by the two smallest cohorts with the lowest PFOS concentrations. DISCUSSION: This study added evidence on deleterious effects of prenatal exposure to BPA and MnBP on child behaviour. Other associations should be interpreted cautiously since they were not consistent with previous studies or they have not been studied extensively.},

In this study, we measured parabens and their metabolites in organs and tissues (blubber, muscle, melon, stomach, kidney, liver, gonad, brain, uterus, and umbilical cord, total n = 94) of common dolphins ( Delphinus capensis) and finless porpoises ( Neophocaena asiaeorientalis), to investigate tissue-specific accumulation and body burden. Among the target compounds, methyl paraben (MeP) and para-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HB) were detected in all organs. Compared to common dolphins, finless porpoises had significantly higher concentrations of MeP and 4-HB due to their near-shore habitat. Higher concentrations of MeP and 4-HB were found in the kidney, liver, and stomach than in other organs, indicating selective accumulation of parabens in certain organs. Significant correlations between MeP and 4-HB in liver/kidney suggested metabolic transformation of the former to the latter. Detection of parabens in brains, umbilical cords, and uteri suggests that these chemicals cross biological barriers such as the blood-brain and placental barriers. The body burdens of total parabens were in the ranges of 13000-90600 {$\mu$}g and 19800-81500 {$\mu$}g for common dolphins and finless porpoises, respectively.},

  abstract = {Mediation analysis aims at disentangling the effects of a treatment on an outcome through alternative causal mechanisms and has become a popular practice in biomedical and social science applications. The causal framework based on counterfactuals is currently the standard approach to mediation, with important methodological advances introduced in the literature in the last decade, especially for simple mediation, that is with one mediator at the time. Among a variety of alternative approaches, K. Imai et al. showed theoretical results and developed an R package to deal with simple mediation as well as with multiple mediation involving multiple mediators conditionally independent given the treatment and baseline covariates. This approach does not allow to consider the often encountered situation in which an unobserved common cause induces a spurious correlation between the mediators. In this context, which we refer to as mediation with uncausally related mediators, we show that, under appropriate hypothesis, the natural direct and joint indirect effects are non-parametrically identifiable. Moreover, we adopt the quasi-Bayesian algorithm developed by Imai et al. and propose a procedure based on the simulation of counterfactual distributions to estimate not only the direct and joint indirect effects but also the indirect effects through individual mediators. We study the properties of the proposed estimators through simulations. As an illustration, we apply our method on a real data set from a large cohort to assess the effect of hormone replacement treatment on breast cancer risk through three mediators, namely dense mammographic area, nondense area and body mass index.},

  abstract = {Background Benzophenones (BPs), parabens, and triclosan (TCS) are widely used in personal care products and may be neurotoxic to children, but limited studies have estimated the associations between exposure to these potential endocrine disrupting chemicals during pregnancy and child neurocognitive development. Objective Our aim was to evaluate the relationships of prenatal exposure to BPs, parabens and TCS with child neurocognitive development at age 2. Methods From 2014 to 2015, 478 mother-child pairs from a longitudinal prenatal cohort in China were included in present study. We quantified BPs, parabens and TCS in three spot urine samples during pregnancy (in the first, second, and third trimester). The Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) test to children was performed at 2 years. Multivariate linear regression models and generalized estimating equations were used to examine changes in mental developmental index (MDI) and psychomotor development index (PDI) per 2-fold increase in averaged and trimester-specific maternal urinary phenols, respectively. Results In the adjusted models, each 2-fold increase in average prenatal paraben concentration was associated with lower MDI scores among girls [-1.08 (95\% CI: -2.10, -0.06) and - 1.51 (95\% CI: -2.69, -0.32) for methyl paraben (Mep) and {$\Sigma$}parabens, respectively], but the association was not statistically significant among boys [-0.24 (95\% CI: -1.46, 0.99), Psex-int = 0.37 and 0.18 (95\% CI: -1.28, 1.64), Psex-int = 0.10 for Mep and {$\Sigma$}parabens, respectively]. Increasing urinary 4-hydroxybenzophenone (4-OH-BP) concentration was associated with lower PDI scores among boys [-2.96 (95\% CI: -4.48, -1.45)], not girls [-0.07 (95\% CI: -1.57, 1.43)] and the association was significantly different in boys and girls (Psex-int = 0.01). No significant associations were observed between the average prenatal TCS exposure and BSID results. In trimester-specific analyses, increasing parabens was associated with lower girls' MDI only in the second trimester, while increasing 4-OH-BP was associated with lower boys' PDI in each trimester. Conclusion Our results suggest that prenatal exposure to BPs and parabens may be associated with impairment in child cognitive abilities at 2 years. Further human and animal studies are needed to verify our results and elucidate the biological mechanisms involved in these associations.},

Results: We detected 52,988 CpG loci significantly associated with sample positions, 112 remained after ComBat correction in the primary dataset. The pre- and postcorrection comparisons indicate the positional effects could alter the measured methylation values and downstream analysis results. Conclusion: Positional effects exist in the Illumina methylation array and may bias the analyses. Using ComBat to correct positional effects is recommended.},

  abstract = {Methods of diagrammatic modelling have been greatly developed in the past two decades. Outside the context of infectious diseases, systematic use of diagrams in epidemiology has been mainly confined to the analysis of a single link: that between a disease outcome and its proximal determinant(s). Transmitted causes ("causes of causes") tend not to be systematically analysed., The infectious disease epidemiology modelling tradition models the human population in its environment, typically with the exposure-health relationship and the determinants of exposure being considered at individual and group/ecological levels, respectively. Some properties of the resulting systems are quite general, and are seen in unrelated contexts such as biochemical pathways. Confining analysis to a single link misses the opportunity to discover such properties., The structure of a causal diagram is derived from knowledge about how the world works, as well as from statistical evidence. A single diagram can be used to characterise a whole research area, not just a single analysis - although this depends on the degree of consistency of the causal relationships between different populations - and can therefore be used to integrate multiple datasets., Additional advantages of system-wide models include: the use of instrumental variables - now emerging as an important technique in epidemiology in the context of mendelian randomisation, but under-used in the exploitation of "natural experiments"; the explicit use of change models, which have advantages with respect to inferring causation; and in the detection and elucidation of feedback.},

  abstract = {While Illumina microarrays can be used successfully for detecting small gene expression changes due to their high degree of technical replicability, there is little information on how different normalization and differential expression analysis strategies affect outcomes. To evaluate this, we assessed concordance across gene lists generated by applying different combinations of normalization strategy and analytical approach to two Illumina datasets with modest expression changes. In addition to using traditional statistical approaches, we also tested an approach based on combinatorial optimization. We found that the choice of both normalization strategy and analytical approach considerably affected outcomes, in some cases leading to substantial differences in gene lists and subsequent pathway analysis results. Our findings suggest that important biological phenomena may be overlooked when there is a routine practice of using only one approach to investigate all microarray datasets. Analytical artefacts of this kind are likely to be especially relevant for datasets involving small fold changes, where inherent technical variation\textemdash if not adequately minimized by effective normalization\textemdash may overshadow true biological variation. This report provides some basic guidelines for optimizing outcomes when working with Illumina datasets involving small expression changes.},

  abstract = {Genomic imprinting is the phenomenon by which individual alleles of certain genes are expressed diVerentially according to their parent of origin. The alleles appear to be diVerentially marked during gametogenesis or during the early part of development. This mark is heritable but reversible from generation to generation, implying a stable epigenetic modification. Approximately 25 imprinted genes have been identified to date, and dysregulation of a number of these has been implicated in tumour development. The normal physiological role of many imprinted genes is in the control of cell proliferation and fetal growth, indicating potential mechanisms of action in tumour formation. Both dominant and recessive modes of action have been postulated for the role of imprinted genes in neoplasia, as a result of eVective gene dosage alterations by epigenetic modification of the normal pattern of allele specific transcription. The aim of this review is to assess the importance of imprinted genes in generating tumours and to discuss the implications for novel mechanisms of transforming mutation.},

Exposome-wide association study (ExWAS) provides a new approach for conceptualizing the roles and relationships of multiple chemical and nonchemical exposures in the etiology and progression of cancer at key developmental periods, over the life course, and across generations. ExWAS challenges us to consider the influence of both internal and external environment, chemical and non-chemical stressors, risk and protective factors, and spatial and temporal dimensions of exposures in our models of cancer incidence, outcomes, and disparities. Applying an ExWAS approach to cancer and cancer disparities research supports robust computational models and methods that will allow for analysis of the dynamic and complex interactions between genetics, epigenetics, and exposomics factors. In the coming months, we will spatially and temporally align environmental exposures with SCCS participant data from time of enrollment forward to move us closer to identifying complete exposure pathways that lead to cancer. In the future, we hope to link external sources of exposure to biomarkers of exposure, biomarkers of disease, disease phenotypes, and population level disparities.},

  abstract = {Background Certain phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA) show reproductive effects in animal studies and potentially affect human ovulation, conception, and pregnancy loss. Objectives We investigated these chemicals in relation to follicular- and luteal-phase lengths, time to pregnancy, and early pregnancy loss (within 6 weeks of the last menstrual period) among women attempting pregnancy. Methods Women discontinuing contraception provided daily first-morning urine specimens and recorded days with vaginal bleeding for up to 6 months. Specimens had previously been analyzed for estrogen and progesterone metabolites and human chorionic gonadotropin. A total of 221 participants contributed 706 menstrual cycles. We measured 11 phthalate metabolites and BPA in pooled urine from three specimens spaced throughout each menstrual cycle. We analyzed associations between chemical concentrations and outcomes using linear mixed models for follicular- and luteal-phase lengths, discrete-time fecundability models for time to pregnancy, and logistic regression for early pregnancy loss. Results Higher concentrations of monocarboxyoctyl phthalate (MCOP) were associated with shorter luteal phase [2nd tertile vs. 1st tertile: \textendash 0.5 days (95\% CI: \textendash 0.9, \textendash 0.1), 3rd vs. 1st: \textendash 0.4 days (95\% CI: \textendash 0.8, 0.01), p = 0.04]. BPA was also associated with shorter luteal phase [2nd vs. 1st: \textendash 0.8 days (95\% CI: \textendash 1.2, \textendash 0.4), 3rd vs. 1st: \textendash 0.4 days (95\% CI: \textendash 0.8, 0.02), p = 0.001]. Conclusions BPA and MCOP (or its precursors) were associated with shorter luteal phase. Menstrual cycle\textendash specific estimates of urinary BPA and phthalate metabolites were not associated with detrimental alterations in follicular-phase length, time to pregnancy, or early pregnancy loss, and in fact, DEHP [di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate] metabolites \{MEOHP [mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate] and {$\Sigma$}DEHP\} were associated with reduced early loss.

In-utero exposure to DDT and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) has been associated with developmental and cognitive impairment among children. We examined this association in an historical cohort in which the level of exposure was greater than in previous studies. METHODS: The association of in-utero DDT and DDE exposure with infant and child neurodevelopment was examined in 1100 subjects in the Collaborative Perinatal Project, a prospective birth cohort enrolling pregnant women from 12 study centers in the United States from 1959 to 1965. Maternal DDT and DDE concentrations were measured in archived serum specimens. Infant mental and motor development was assessed at age 8 months using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, and child cognitive development was assessed at age 7 years, using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. RESULTS: Although levels of DDT and DDE were relatively high in this population (median DDT concentration, 8.9 {$\mu$}g/L; DDE, 24.5 {$\mu$}g/L), neither were related to Mental or Psychomotor Development scores on the Bayley Scales nor to Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient at 7 years of age. Categorical analyses showed no evidence of dose- response for either maternal DDT or DDE, and estimates of the association between continuous measures of exposure and neurodevelopment were indistinguishable from 0. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse associations were not observed between maternal serum DDT and DDE concentrations and offspring neurodevelopment at 8 months or 7 years in this cohort.},

OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to determine whether maternal urinary concentrations of OP pesticide metabolites are inversely associated with child nonverbal IQ at 6 y of age and to examine potential effect measure modification by the PON1 gene. METHODS: Data came from 708 mother\textendash child pairs participating in the Generation R Study. Maternal urine concentrations of six dialkylphosphates (DAPs), collected at {$<$}18, 18\textendash 25, and {$>$}25 weeks of gestation, were determined. Child nonverbal IQ was measured at 6 y of age using the Mosaics and Categories subtests from the Snijders-Oomen Nonverbal Intelligence Test\textendash Revised. PON1 was determined in cord blood for 474 infants. Multiple linear regression models were fit to estimate the DAP\textendash IQ associations and PON1 interactions. RESULTS: Overall, associations between child nonverbal IQ and maternal DAP concentrations were small and imprecise, and these associations were inconsistent across urine sampling periods. However, for a 10-fold difference in total DAP concentration for the {$>$}25 weeks of gestation samples, adjusted child nonverbal IQ was 3.9 points lower (95\% CI: -7:5, -0:3). Heterogeneity in the DAP\textendash IQ association by PON1 gene allele status was not observed (n = 474). CONCLUSIONS: Consistent evidence of an association between higher maternal urinary DAP concentrations and lower child IQ scores at 6 y of age was not observed. There was some evidence for an inverse relation of child nonverbal IQ and late pregnancy urinary DAPs, but the estimated association was imprecise. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP3024},

Infants can be exposed to chemicals either prenatally, by trans-placental passage of chemicals, or postnatally by their own diet and by other external pathways (air inhalation, dust, hand-to-mouth exposure) after birth. To provide a review of epidemiological evidence on the association between prenatal exposure to chemicals and prenatal and postnatal growth, we present the literature from systematic review articles and international meta-analyses, when available, or recent research articles when summarizing articles were not available. The most studied contaminants in this field were persistent organic pollutants (e.g. organochlorinated pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls), non-persistent pollutants (e.g. phthalates, bisphenol A), toxic heavy metals (i.e. cadmium, lead and mercury), arsenic, mycotoxins and acrylamide. Mounting evidence suggests that child's growth may be associated with prenatal or postnatal exposures to environmental contaminants. Improving exposure assessment and studying the contaminants as mixtures should allow to gain knowledge about the environmental determinants of growth and obesity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The human chromosome 14q32.2 imprinted region harbors the primary MEG3/DLK1:IG-differentially methylated region (DMR) and secondary MEG3:TSS-DMR. The MEG3:TSS-DMR can remain unmethylated only in the presence of unmethylated MEG3/DLK1:IG-DMR in somatic tissues, but not in the placenta, because of a hierarchical regulation of the methylation pattern between the two DMRs. METHODS: We performed molecular studies in a 4-year-old Japanese girl with Temple syndrome (TS14). RESULTS: Pyrosequencing analysis showed extremely low methylation levels of five CpGs at the MEG3:TSS-DMR and grossly normal methylation levels of four CpGs at the MEG3/DLK1:IG-DMR in leukocytes. HumanMethylation450 BeadChip confirmed marked hypomethylation of the MEG3:TSS-DMR and revealed multilocus imprinting disturbance (MLID) including mild hypomethylation of the H19/IGF2:IG-DMR and mild hypermethylation of the GNAS A/B:TSS-DMR in leukocytes. Bisulfite sequencing showed markedly hypomethylated CpGs at the MEG3:TSS-DMR and irregularly and non-differentially methylated CpGs at the MEG3/DLK1:IG-DMR in leukocytes and apparently normal methylation patterns of the two DMRs in the placenta. Maternal uniparental disomy 14 and a deletion involving this imprinted region were excluded. CONCLUSIONS: Such a methylation pattern of the MEG3/DLK1:IG-DMR has not been reported in patients with TS14. It may be possible that a certain degree of irregular hypomethylation at the MEG3/DLK1:IG-DMR has prevented methylation of the MEG3:TSS-DMR in somatic tissues and that a hypermethylation type MLID has occurred at the MEG3/DLK1:IG-DMR to yield the apparently normal methylation pattern in the placenta.},

Evidence is particularly strong for relations between perfluoroalkyl substances and child and adult obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, gestational diabetes, reduced birthweight, reduced semen quality, polycystic ovarian syndrome, endometriosis, and breast cancer. Evidence also exists for relations between bisphenols and adult diabetes, reduced semen quality, and polycystic ovarian syndrome; phthalates and prematurity, reduced anogenital distance in boys, childhood obesity, and impaired glucose tolerance; organophosphate pesticides and reduced semen quality; and occupational exposure to pesticides and prostate cancer. Greater evidence has accumulated than was previously identified for cognitive deficits and attention-deficit disorder in children following prenatal exposure to bisphenol A, organophosphate pesticides, and polybrominated flame retardants. Although systematic evaluation is needed of the probability and strength of these exposure\textendash outcome relations, the growing evidence supports urgent action to reduce exposure to EDCs.},

Differential expression was initially identified by microarray analysis and confirmed by real time PCR in 42 B-CLL patients. mRNA expression ranged from 0.3- to 375.4-fold compared to normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC). Expression levels in CD19+ B-CLL cells were 100-fold higher than in B-cells from healthy donors. PEG10 expression levels in B-CLL patient samples remained stable over time even after chemotherapy. High PEG10 expression correlated with high LPL expression (p=0.001) and a positive Coombs' test (p=0.04). Interestingly, similar expression patterns were observed for the neighbouring imprinted gene sarcoglycan-epsilon (SGCE). Monoallelic expression and maintained imprinting of PEG10 were found by allele- or methylation-specific PCR. The intensity of intracellular staining of PEG10 protein corresponded to mRNA levels as confirmed by immunofluorescence staining. Short term knock-down of PEG10 in B-CLL cells and HepG2 cells was not associated with changes in cell survival but resulted in a significant change in the expression of 80 genes. However, long term inhibition of PEG10 led to induction of apoptosis in B-CLL cells. Our data indicate (i) a prognostic value of PEG10 in B-CLL patients; (ii) specific deregulation of the imprinted locus at 7q21 in high-risk B-CLL; (iii) a potential functional and biological role of PEG10 protein expression. Altogether, PEG10 represents a novel marker in B-CLL.},

The impact of EDC on the differentiation of primitive cells, e.g. in hematopoiesis, is of particular interest. We found profound inhibitory effects of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) on erythropoiesis and dendropoiesis, mediated via reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Neutrophil differentiation, however, was not affected by DEHP. ROS leads to a shift from glycolysis to the pentose phosphate pathway and diminishes ATP generation from glycolysis, ultimately resulting in apoptosis in both cell types. In neutrophils, ATP generation is held constant by active fatty acid oxidation (FAO), rendering these cells highly resistant against ROS. This relationship also holds true in HUVEC and HepG2 cells, also in combination with other organic peroxides. We, therefore, uncover a key mechanism for ROS quenching which further explains the distinct ROS quenching ability of different tissues.},

Using three approaches, we estimated covariate-adjusted associations of chemical mixtures or individual chemicals with gestational-age-specific birth weight z-scores, birth length, head circumference, and gestational age: k-means clustering, principal components (PC), and one-chemical-at-a-time regression. Results: We identified three chemical mixture profiles using k-means clustering. Women in cluster 1 had higher concentrations of most phenols, three phthalate metabolites, several metals, organophosphate/organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, and several PFAS than women in clusters 2 and 3. On average, infants born to women in clusters 1 (-1.2 cm; 95\% CI: -1.9, -0.5) and 2 (-0.5 cm; 95\% CI: -1.1, 0.1) had lower birth length than infants in cluster 3. Six PCs explained 50\% of the variance in biomarker concentrations and biomarkers with similar chemical structures or from shared commercial/industrial settings loaded onto commons PCs. Each standard deviation increase in PC 1 (organochlorine pesticides, some phenols) and PC 6 (cadmium, bisphenol A) was associated with 0.2 cm (95\% CI: -0.4, 0.0) and 0.1 cm (95\% CI: -0.4, 0.1) lower birth length, respectively. Organochlorine compounds, parabens, and cadmium were inversely associated with birth length in the one-chemical-at-a-time analysis. Cluster membership, PC scores, and individual chemicals were not associated with other birth outcomes. Conclusion: All three methods of characterizing multiple chemical exposures in this cohort identified inverse associations of select organochlorine compounds, phenols, and cadmium with birth length, but not other neonatal outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background: Non-persistent chemicals, such as phthalates, environmental phenols, organophosphate pesticides, and others, are challenging to study because of their ubiquity in the environment, diverse exposure routes, and high temporal variability of biomarkers. Nonetheless, there is interest in understanding how gestational exposure to these chemicals may affect fetal growth, as perturbations to normal fetal growth are related to a plethora of adverse health outcomes in childhood and adulthood. Methods: The purpose of this review is to describe the state of the science on this topic. We searched PubMed for studies that included both 1) biomarkers of non-persistent chemicals collected during pregnancy and 2) fetal growth outcomes measured at birth (e.g., birth weight) or by ultrasound in utero (e.g., estimated fetal weight). Results: The bulk of the literature we found uses biomarkers measured at a single time point in pregnancy and birth weight as the primary measure of fetal growth. There is a small, but growing, body of research that uses ultrasound measures to assess fetal growth during pregnancy. In addition to summarizing the findings of the publications we identified, we describe inconsistencies in methodology, areas for improvement, and gaps in existing knowledge that can be targeted for improvement in future work. This literature is characterized by variability in methodology, likely contributing to the inconsistency of results reported. We further discuss maternal, placental, and fetal pathways by which these classes of chemicals may affect fetal growth. Conclusions: To improve understanding of how everyday chemical exposures affect fetal growth, and ultimately lifelong health outcomes, mechanisms of toxicant action should be considered alongside improved study designs for future hypothesis-driven research.},

The present study was designed to determine urinary paraben levels among pregnant women and their matching newborn infants ({$<$}48 h after delivery), and the association between paraben levels and stress markers. Pregnant women (n=46) and their matching newborn infants were recruited from four university hospitals located in Seoul, Ansan and Jeju of Korea, 2011. Parabens including methyl paraben (MP), ethyl paraben (EP), n-propyl paraben (PP), and n-butyl paraben (BP) were measured in the urine using an automatic, high throughput online SPE-LC-MS/MS method. Urinary concentrations were normalized with specific gravity (SG). Free cortisol, malondealdehyde (MDA) and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were measured in the urine as stress marker. Urinary MP was detected as the highest, and BP was detected as the lowest paraben in the urine samples of both pregnant women and their infants. Significant correlations between paraben concentrations of maternal and their newborn infant's urine were observed. The levels of urinary parabens among Korean pregnant women are comparable to those reported elsewhere, except for EP which were 4-9 folds higher than pregnant women of other countries. The ratios of infant to maternal urinary paraben concentrations varied between 0.5 and 0.6 for MP and PP, but approximately 10 fold lower for EP. Urinary MP or EP levels were associated with several oxidative stress related biomarkers such as urinary 8-OHdG and MDA, even after the adjustment of relevant covariates such as maternal age, mode of delivery, pre-pregnancy BMI, gestational age and parity. This is the first study that reported the levels of major parabens in the first urine of newborn infants. Further studies are warranted to understand the implications of paraben exposure among biologically susceptible human populations.},

However, a comprehensive assessment of the role of placental imprinted gene expression on fetal growth has yet to be conducted. In this study, we examined the association between the placental expression of 108 established and putative imprinted genes and birth weight in 677 term pregnancies, oversampled for small for gestational age (SGA) and large for gestational age (LGA) infants. Using adjusted multinomial regression analyses, a 2-fold increase in the expression of 9 imprinted genes was positively associated with LGA status: BLCAP [odds ratio (OR) = 3.78, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.83, 7.82], DLK1 [OR = 1.63, 95\% CI: 1.27, 2.09], H19 [OR = 2.79, 95\% CI: 1.77, 4.42], IGF2 [OR = 1.43, 95\% CI:1.31, 2.40], MEG3 [OR = 1.42, 95\% CI: 1.19, 1.71], MEST [OR = 4.78, 95\% CI: 2.64, 8.65], NNAT [OR = 1.40, 95\% CI: 1.05, 1.86], NDN [OR = 2.52, 95\% CI: 1.72, 3.68], and PLAGL1 [OR = 1.85, 95\% CI: 1.40, 2.44]. For SGA status, a 2-fold increase in MEST expression was associated with decreased risk [OR = 0.31, 95\% CI: 0.17, 0.58], while a 2-fold increase in NNAT expression was associated with increased risk [OR = 1.52, 95\% CI: 1.1, 2.1]. Following a factor analysis, all genes significantly associated with SGA or LGA status loaded onto 2 of the 8 gene-sets underlying the variability in the dataset. Our comprehensive placental profiling of imprinted genes in a large birth cohort supports the importance of these genes for fetal growth. Given that abnormal birth weight is implicated in numerous diseases and developmental abnormalities, the expression pattern of placental imprinted genes has the potential to be developed as a novel biomarker for postnatal health outcomes.},

These haploid genes are highly active in the placenta and are functionally implicated in the appropriate development of the fetus. Furthermore, the epigenetic marks regulating imprinted expression patterns are established early in development. These characteristics make genomic imprinting a potentially useful biomarker for environmental insults, especially during the in utero or early development stages, and for health outcomes later in life. Herein, we critically review the current literature regarding environmental influences on imprinted genes and summarize findings that suggest that imprinted loci are sensitive to known teratogenic agents, such as alcohol and tobacco, as well as less established factors with the potential to manipulate the in utero environment, including assisted reproductive technology. Finally, we discuss the potential of genomic imprinting to serve as an environmental sensor during early development.},

FOXE3-FOXD2 (1p33), FOXQ1-FOXF2-FOXC1 (6p25.3), and FOXF1-FOXC2-FOXL1 (16q24.1) loci are FOX gene clusters within the human genome. Members of FOX subfamilies A-G, I-L and Q were grouped into class 1 FOX proteins, while members of FOX subfamilies H and M-P were grouped into class 2 FOX proteins. C-terminal basic region within the FOX domain was the common feature of class 1 FOX proteins. FOXH1 and FOXO1 mRNAs are expressed in human embryonic stem (ES) cells. FOXC1, FOXC2, FOXE1, FOXE3, FOXL2, FOXN1, FOXP2 and FOXP3 genes are mutated in human congenital disorders. FOXA1 gene is amplified and over-expressed in esophageal and lung cancer. FOXM1 gene is up-regulated in pancreatic cancer and basal cell carcinoma due to the transcriptional regulation by Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway. FOXO1 gene is fused to PAX3 or PAX7 genes in rhabdomyosarcoma. FOXO3 and FOXO4 genes are fused to MLL gene in hematological malignancies. Deregulation of FOX family genes leads to congenital disorders, diabetes mellitus, or carcinogenesis. Expression profiles, genetic alterations and epigenetic changes of FOX family genes as well as binding proteins and target genes of FOX family transcription factors should be comprehensively investigated to develop novel therapeutics and preventives for human diseases.},

  abstract = {Background: Whole blood is frequently utilized in genome-wide association studies of DNA methylation patterns in relation to environmental exposures or clinical outcomes. These associations can be confounded by cellular heterogeneity. Algorithms have been developed to measure or adjust for this heterogeneity, and some have been compared in the literature. However, with new methods available, it is unknown whether the findings will be consistent, if not which method(s) perform better. Results: Methods: We compared eight cell-type correction methods including the method in the minfi R package, the method by Houseman et al., the Removing unwanted variation (RUV) approach, the methods in FaST-LMMEWASher, ReFACTor, RefFreeEWAS, and RefFreeCellMix R programs, along with one approach utilizing surrogate variables (SVAs). We first evaluated the association of DNA methylation at each CpG across the whole genome with prenatal arsenic exposure levels and with cancer status, adjusted for estimated cell-type information obtained from different methods. We then compared CpGs showing statistical significance from different approaches. For the methods implemented in minfi and proposed by Houseman et al., we utilized homogeneous data with composition of some blood cells available and compared them with the estimated cell compositions. Finally, for methods not explicitly estimating cell compositions, we evaluated their performance using simulated DNA methylation data with a set of latent variables representing ``cell types''. Results: Results from the SVA-based method overall showed the highest agreement with all other methods except for FaST-LMM-EWASher. Using homogeneous data, minfi provided better estimations on cell types compared to the originally proposed method by Houseman et al. Further simulation studies on methods free of reference data revealed that SVA provided good sensitivities and specificities, RefFreeCellMix in general produced high sensitivities but specificities tended to be low when confounding is present, and FaST-LMM-EWASher gave the lowest sensitivity but highest specificity. Conclusions: Results from real data and simulations indicated that SVA is recommended when the focus is on the identification of informative CpGs. When appropriate reference data are available, the method implemented in the minfi package is recommended. However, if no such reference data are available or if the focus is not on estimating cell proportions, the SVA method is suggested.},

Sliding window methods that calculate moving averages of log ratios or t-statistics have been useful for the analysis of tiling array data.

In particular, the combined p-value framework can be useful in situations when taking averages of the corresponding test-statistic for the hypothesis may not be appropriate or when it is difficult to assess the significance of these averages. We exhibit the strengths of the combined p-values methods on Drosophila tiling array data and assess their ability to predict genomic regions enriched for transcription factor binding. The predictions are evaluated based on their proximity to target genes and their enrichment of known transcription factor binding sites. We also present an application for the generalization of the moving average based on integrating two different tiling array experiments.},

It comprises a bewildering array of alternative transcripts determined by differentially imprinted promoters which encode distinct proteins. It also provides the classic example of tissue-specific imprinted gene expression, in which the canonical GNAS transcript coding for Gs{$\alpha$} is expressed predominantly from the maternal allele in a set of seemingly unrelated tissues. Functionally, this rather obscure imprinting is nevertheless of considerable clinical significance, as it dictates the nature of the disease caused by inactivating mutations in Gs{$\alpha$}, with end organ hormone resistance specifically on maternal transmission (pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a, PHP1a). In addition, there is a bona fide imprinting disorder, PHP1b, which is caused specifically by DNA methylation defects in the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that determine tissue-specific monoallelic expression of GNAS. Although the genetic defect in PHP1a and the disrupted imprinting in PHP1b both essentially result in profound reduction of Gs{$\alpha$} activity in tissues with monoallelic GNAS expression, and despite a growing awareness of the overlap in these two conditions, there are important pathophysiological differences between the two whose basis is not fully understood. PHP1b is one of the only imprinted gene syndromes in which cis-acting mutations have been discovered that disrupt methylation of germline-derived imprint marks; such imprinting mutations in GNAS are helping to provide important new insights into the mechanisms of imprinting establishment generally. \textcopyright{} 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Measurement error and misclassification of variables frequently occur in epidemiology and involve variables important to public health. Their presence can impact strongly on results of statistical analyses involving such variables. However, investigators commonly fail to pay attention to biases resulting from such mismeasurement. We provide, in two parts, an overview of the types of error that occur, their impacts on analytic results, and statistical methods to mitigate the biases that they cause. In this first part, we review different types of measurement error and misclassification, emphasizing the classical, linear, and Berkson models, and on the concepts of nondifferential and differential error. We describe the impacts of these types of error in covariates and in outcome variables on various analyses, including estimation and testing in regression models and estimating distributions. We outline types of ancillary studies required to provide information about such errors and discuss the implications of covariate measurement error for study design. Methods for ascertaining sample size requirements are outlined, both for ancillary studies designed to provide information about measurement error and for main studies where the exposure of interest is measured with error. We describe two of the simpler methods, regression calibration and simulation extrapolation (SIMEX), that adjust for bias in regression coefficients caused by measurement error in continuous covariates, and illustrate their use through examples drawn from the Observing Protein and Energy (OPEN) dietary validation study. Finally, we review software available for implementing these methods. The second part of the article deals with more advanced topics.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) are ideally suited to identify differentially methylated genes in response to starvation. METHODS: We examined high-throughput DNA methylation derived from whole blood of 47 females with AN, 47 lean females without AN and 100 population-based females to compare AN with both controls. To account for different cell type compositions, we applied two reference-free methods (FastLMM-EWASher, RefFreeEWAS) and searched for consensus CpG sites identified by both methods. We used a validation sample of five monozygotic AN-discordant twin pairs. RESULTS: Fifty-one consensus sites were identified in AN vs. lean and 81 in AN vs. population-based comparisons. These sites have not been reported in AN methylation analyses, but for the latter comparison 54/81 sites showed directionally consistent differential methylation effects in the AN-discordant twins. For a single nucleotide polymorphism rs923768 in CSGALNACT1 a nearby site was nominally associated with AN. At the gene level, we confirmed hypermethylated sites at TNXB. We found support for a locus at NR1H3 in the AN vs. lean control comparison, but the methylation direction was opposite to the one previously reported. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm genes like TNXB previously described to comprise differentially methylated sites, and highlight further sites that might be specifically involved in AN starvation processes.},

By binding to its neogenin receptor, RGMa caused the collapse of growth cones and encouraged axons to grow along specific trajectories in vitro. Although originally characterized in 1990, RGMa was not conclusively shown to mediate axon guidance in vivo for another 12 years. Loss-of-function analysis in mice revealed that RGMa may play a more important role in neural tube morphogenesis. RGMa has now emerged as a molecule with pleiotropic roles involving cell adhesion, cell migration, cell polarity and cell differentiation which together strongly influence early morphogenetic events as well as immune responses. RGMa can be regarded as a molecule for all seasons.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence of neurological, cognitive, and neuropsychological effects of manganese (Mn) exposure from drinking water (WMn) in children has generated widespread public health concern. At elevated exposures, Mn has been associated with increased levels of externalizing behaviors, including irritability, aggression, and impulsivity. Little is known about potential effects at lower exposures, especially in children. Moreover, little is known regarding potential interactions between exposure to Mn and other metals, especially arsenic (As). OBJECTIVES: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 201 children to investigate associations of Mn and As in tube well water with classroom behavior among elementary school children, 8-11 years of age, in Araihazar, Bangladesh. METHODS: Data on exposures and behavioral outcomes were collected from the participants at the baseline of an ongoing longitudinal study of child intelligence. Study children were rated by their school teachers on externalizing and internalizing items of classroom behavior using the standardized Child Behavior Checklist-Teacher's Report Form (CBCL-TRF). RESULTS: Log-transformed WMn was positively and significantly associated with TRF internalizing [estimated {$\beta$} = 0.82; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.08-1.56; p = 0.03], TRF externalizing (estimated {$\beta$} = 2.59; 95\% CI, 0.81-4.37; p =0.004), and TRF total scores (estimated {$\beta$} = 3.35; 95\% CI, 0.86-5.83; p = 0.008) in models that adjusted for log-transformed water arsenic (WAs) and sociodemographic covariates. We also observed a positive monotonic dose-response relationship between WMn and TRF externalizing and TRF total scores among the participants of the study. We did not find any significant associations between WAs and various scales of TRF scores. CONCLUSION: These observations reinforce the growing concern regarding the neurotoxicologic effects of WMn in children.},

Materials and Methods: This systematic review and meta analysis was conducted based on the identified published papers in Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed up to November 2019. All steps, including searching, screening, data extracting, and quality assessment, were done by two independent researchers. Results: Finally 15 published papers selected. The number of participants in whom the association of TCS exposure was assessed with birth weight, birth length, birth head circumference, and gestational age were 9112, 4311, 2854, and 3181 mother infant pairs, respectively. The pooled analysis showed that TCS exposure during pregnancy leads to increasing the birth weight for boys with {$\beta$}= 3.97 and 95\% confidence interval (CI) (-3.98, 11.92), and girls with {$\beta$}= 5.37, 95\% CI (-6.00, 16.75), but the association was not statistically significant. In addition, according to fixed effects models, the TCS exposure was not significantly associated with birth length (-0.008, 95\% CI [-0.049, 0.034]), birth head circumference (-0.01, 95\% CI [-0.08, 0.06]), and gestational age (-0.005, 95\% CI [-0.017, 0.006]). Likewise, analysis for data segregated by gender of infants revealed similar results. Conclusion: The obtained results depicted that the TCS exposure during pregnancy period was associated with higher birth weight for boys and girls. No significant association was observed for TCS exposure with variation of birth length, head circumference, and gestational age duration. In fact, the results showed the evidence of null associations between maternal TCS exposure and birth outcomes.},

  abstract = {Children born preterm are reported to be at increased risk of developing noncommunicable diseases in later life. Altered placental DNA methylation patterns are implicated in fetal programming of adult diseases. Our earlier animal studies focus on micronutrients (folic acid, vitamin B12) and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) that interact in the I carbon cycle, thereby influencing methylation reactions. Our previous studies in women delivering preterm show altered plasma levels of micronutrients and lower plasma LCPUFA levels. We postulate that alterations in the micronutrient metabolism may affect the regulation of enzymes, methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT2A), and SAH-hydrolase (AHCY), involved in the production of methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), thereby influencing the methylation potential (MP) in the placenta of women delivering preterm. The present study, therefore, examines the mRNA, protein levels of enzymes (MAT2A and AHCY), SAM, S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) levels, and global DNA methylation levels from preterm (n = 73) and term (n = 73) placentae. The enzyme messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, protein levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and SAM-SAH levels by high-performance liquid chromatography. The mRNA levels for MAT2A and AHCY are higher (P {$<$} .05 for both) in the preterm group as compared to the term group. S-Adenosylmethionine and SAH levels were similar in both groups, although SAM:SAH ratio was lower (P {$<$} .05) in the preterm group as compared to the term group. The global DNA methylation levels were higher (P {$<$} .05) in women delivering small for gestation age infants as compared to women delivering appropriate for gestation age infants at term. Our data showing lower MP in the preterm placenta may have implications for the epigenetic programming of the developing fetus.},

However, many aspects of metal neurotoxicity remain unclear including the magnitude of the low-level exposure effects and the level of exposure that can be assumed safe. The aim of our study was to investigate the association between a low-level metal exposure and three neurobehavioral domains (sustained attention, short-term memory, and manual motor speed). We measured Cd, Cu, Mn, Pb, and Tl in blood, Cd, Ni, and toxicologically relevant As in urine and methyl Hg in hair in 606 adolescents between 13.6 and 17 years of age. A two-fold increase in blood Cu was associated with a 0.37 standard deviations decrease in sustained attention (95\% CI: -0.67 to -0.07, p = 0.02) and 0.39 standard deviations decrease in short-term memory (95\% CI: -0.70 to -0.07, p = 0.02), accounting for gender, age, smoking, passive smoking, household income per capita, occupation of the parents, and education level of the mother. None of the other metals was significantly associated with the neurobehavioral domains that were measured. The observed associations between blood Cu and neurobehavioral performance are in line with recent studies in elderly. However, the relevance of our results for public health remains to be elucidated.},

Prenatal mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP) were measured in one urine sample acquired from each mother during the third trimester of pregnancy. Associations with log-transformed creatinine-corrected phthalate concentrations were estimated using linear regression models adjusted for potential confounders., Results: MDI was inversely associated with the natural log concentrations (micrograms per gram creatinine) of MEHHP [{$\beta$} = \textendash 0.97; confidence interval (CI), \textendash 1.85 to \textendash 0.08] and MEOHP ({$\beta$} = \textendash 0.95; CI, \textendash 1.87 to \textendash 0.03), and PDI was inversely associated with MEHHP ({$\beta$} = \textendash 1.20; CI, \textendash 2.33 to \textendash 0.08).

Their total body burden and their contribution to obesity-associated diseases remain unclear. Objectives: We characterized POP total body burden and their redistribution in obese individuals before and after drastic weight loss and compared these values with a variety of molecular, biological, and clinical parameters. Methods: Seventy-one obese subjects were enrolled and underwent bariatric surgery. Blood and adipose tissue samples were obtained at different times from these individuals as well as from 18 lean women. Results: POP content (17 dioxins/furans and 18 polychlorinated biphenyl congeners) in different adipose tissue territories was similar, allowing us to assess total POP body burden from a single biopsy. Total POP body burden was 2 to 3 times higher in obese than in lean individuals. We also found increased expression of some POP target genes in obese adipose tissue. Drastic weight loss led to increased serum POPs and, within 6\textendash 12 months, to a significant 15\% decrease in total polychlorinated biphenyl body burden. Importantly, serum POP levels were positively correlated with liver toxicity markers and lipid parameters, independently of age and body mass index. Conclusions: POP content in adipose tissue and serum correlate with biological markers of obesityrelated dysfunctions. Drastic weight loss leads to a redistribution of POPs and to a moderate decrease of their total body burden.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is now compelling evidence that epigenetic modifications link adult disease susceptibility to environmental exposures during specific life stages, including pre-pubertal development. Animal studies indicate that bisphenol A (BPA), the monomer used in epoxy resins and polycarbonate plastics, may impact health through epigenetic mechanisms, and epidemiological data associate BPA levels with metabolic disorders, behavior changes, and reproductive effects. Thus, we conducted an environmental epidemiology study of BPA exposure and CpG methylation in pre-adolescent girls from Gharbiah, Egypt hypothesizing that methylation profiles exhibit exposure-dependent trends. METHODS: Urinary concentrations of total (free plus conjugated) species of BPA in spot samples were quantified for 60 girls aged 10 to 13. Genome-wide CpG methylation was concurrently measured in bisulfite-converted saliva DNA using the Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (N\,=\,46). CpG sites from four candidate genes were validated via quantitative bisulfite pyrosequencing. RESULTS: CpG methylation varied widely among girls, and higher urinary BPA concentrations were generally associated with less genomic methylation. Based on pathway analyses, genes exhibiting reduced methylation with increasing urinary BPA were involved in immune function, transport activity, metabolism, and caspase activity. In particular, hypomethylation of CpG targets on chromosome X was associated with higher urinary BPA. Using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database, we identified a number of candidate genes in our sample that previously have been associated with BPA-related expression change. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that BPA may affect human health through specific epigenomic modification of genes in relevant pathways. Thus, epigenetic epidemiology holds promise for the identification of biomarkers from previous exposures and the development of epigenetic-based diagnostic strategies.},

The widespread use of BP-3 has resulted in its release into the water environment, and hence its potential impact on aquatic ecosystem is of concern. To better understand the risk associated with BP-3 in aquatic ecosystems, we conducted a thorough review of available articles regarding the physicochemical properties, toxicokinetics, environmental occurrence, and toxic effects of BP-3 and its suspected metabolites. BP-3 is lipophilic, photostable, and bioaccumulative, and can be rapidly absorbed via oral and dermal routes. BP-3 is reported to be transformed into three major metabolites in vivo, i.e., benzophenone-1 (BP-1), benzophenone-8 (BP-8), and 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzophenone (THB). BP-1 has a longer biological half-life than its parent compound and exhibits greater estrogenic potency in vitro. BP-3 has been detected in water, soil, sediments, sludge, and biota. The maximum detected level in ambient freshwater and seawater is 125ng/L and 577.5ng/L, respectively, and in wastewater influent is 10,400ng/L. The major sources of BP-3 are reported to be human recreational activities and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. BP-3 and its derivatives have been also detected in fish lipid. In humans, BP-3 has been detected in urine, serum, and breast milk samples worldwide. BP-1 has also been detected in placental tissues of delivering women. While sunscreens and cosmetics are known to be major sources of exposure, the fact that BP-3 has been detected frequently among young children and men suggests other sources. An increasing number of in vitro studies have indicated the endocrine disrupting capacity of BP-3. Based on a receptor binding assay, BP-3 has shown strong anti-androgenic and weak estrogenic activities but at the same time BP-3 displays anti-estrogenic activity as well. Predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) for BP-3 was derived at 1.32{$\mu$}g/L. The levels observed in ambient water are generally an order of magnitude lower than the PNEC, but in wastewater influents, hazard quotients (HQs) greater than 1 were noted. Considering limited ecotoxicological information and significant seasonal and spatial variations of BP-3 in water, further studies on environmental monitoring and potential consequences of long-term exposure in aquatic ecosystem are warranted.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Environmental factors during perinatal development may influence developmental plasticity and disease susceptibility via alterations to the epigenome. Developmental exposure to the endocrine active compound, bisphenol A (BPA), has previously been associated with altered methylation at candidate gene loci. Here, we undertake the first genome-wide characterization of DNA methylation profiles in the liver of murine offspring exposed perinatally to multiple doses of BPA through the maternal diet. RESULTS: Using a tiered focusing approach, our strategy proceeds from unbiased broad DNA methylation analysis using methylation-based next generation sequencing technology to in-depth quantitative site-specific CpG methylation determination using the Sequenom EpiTYPER MassARRAY platform to profile liver DNA methylation patterns in offspring maternally exposed to BPA during gestation and lactation to doses ranging from 0 BPA/kg (Ctr), 50 {$\mu$}g BPA/kg (UG), or 50 mg BPA/kg (MG) diet (N = 4 per group). Genome-wide analyses indicate non-monotonic effects of DNA methylation patterns following perinatal exposure to BPA, corroborating previous studies using multiple doses of BPA with non-monotonic outcomes. We observed enrichment of regions of altered methylation (RAMs) within CpG island (CGI) shores, but little evidence of RAM enrichment in CGIs. An analysis of promoter regions identified several hundred novel BPA-associated methylation events, and methylation alterations in the Myh7b and Slc22a12 gene promoters were validated. Using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database, a number of candidate genes that have previously been associated with BPA-related gene expression changes were identified, and gene set enrichment testing identified epigenetically dysregulated pathways involved in metabolism and stimulus response. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, non-monotonic dose dependent alterations in DNA methylation among BPA-exposed mouse liver samples and their relevant pathways were identified and validated. The comprehensive methylome map presented here provides candidate loci underlying the role of early BPA exposure and later in life health and disease status.},

Several chemicals have been associated with adverse neurodevelopmental disorders in the early life stages of humans. However, most epidemiological studies have focused on a limited number of chemicals, and hence may exclude important chemicals from consideration or result in conclusions built on associations by chance. In the present study, we investigated the chemical exposure profile of the women, and associated these with the early neurodevelopmental performance of their offspring at 13-24months of age. The chemicals assessed include four phthalates, bisphenol A, three heavy metals, 19 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 19 organochlorine pesticides, and 19 polybrominated diphenyl ethers, which were measured from urine, whole blood, serum, and/or breastmilk of the pregnant or lactating women. For neurodevelopmental performance, the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II (BSID-II), Social Maturity Scale (SMS), and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) were measured from a total of 140 toddlers. Among the measured chemicals, monoethyl phthalate (MEP) in maternal urine was significantly associated with early mental, psychomotor, and social development. In addition, breast milk di-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) metabolite and blood lead concentrations were inversely associated with mental and psychomotor development indices, respectively. Maternal blood PCB153, heavy metals, and urinary MEP levels were also higher among the children with behavioral problems, as indicated by the CBCL range. Taken together, maternal exposure to several EDCs such as PCBs and DEHP was associated with adverse neurodevelopmental performances among the children aged 1-2years. Confirmation of these association in larger populations, as well as longer-term consequences of such exposure warrant further investigation.},

The methylation status was analyzed for CpG sites of DRD4. Multivariable linear regression models were applied to investigate the interaction effects of methylation and phthalate levels. Results: There was a significant interaction effect of the methylation of CpG26 and CpG28 with the MEHHP level on omission errors in ADHD patients, but not in controls. The post hoc analysis revealed a significant correlation between the MEHHP concentration and omission errors in the methylated group, but not in the unmethylated group. Conclusion: The interaction between the methylation status of CpG sites of DRD4, particularly CpG26 and CpG28, and phthalate metabolite levels affects the attention level in ADHD patients.},

Regarding PFOS and PFOA occurrence, the final data set available for dietary exposure assessment contained a total of 20,019 analytical results (PFOS n = 10,191 and PFOA n = 9,828). There were large differences between upper and lower bound exposure due to analytical methods with insufficient sensitivity. The CONTAM Panel considered the lower bound estimates to be closer to true exposure levels. Important contributors to the lower bound mean chronic exposure were `Fish and other seafood', `Meat and meat products' and `Eggs and egg products', for PFOS, and `Milk and dairy products', `Drinking water' and `Fish and other seafood' for PFOA. PFOS and PFOA are readily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, excreted in urine and faeces, and do not undergo metabolism. Estimated human half-lives for PFOS and PFOA are about 5 years and 2\textendash 4 years, respectively. The derivation of a health-based guidance value was based on human epidemiological studies. For PFOS, the increase in serum total cholesterol in adults, and the decrease in antibody response at vaccination in children were identified as the critical effects. For PFOA, the increase in serum total cholesterol was the critical effect. Also reduced birth weight (for both compounds) and increased prevalence of high serum levels of the liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (for PFOA) were considered. After benchmark modelling of serum levels of PFOS and PFOA, and estimating the corresponding daily intakes, the CONTAM Panel established a tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of 13 ng/kg body weight (bw) per week for PFOS and 6 ng/kg bw per week for PFOA. For both compounds, exposure of a considerable proportion of the population exceeds the proposed TWIs.},

OBJECTIVES: We examined associations between prenatal urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites and neurobehavioral scores among children. METHODS: We measured phthalate metabolite concentrations in urine samples from 153 pregnant participants in the Study for Future Families, a multicenter cohort study. Mothers completed the Child Behavior Checklist when the children were 6-10 years of age. We estimated overall and sex-specific associations between phthalate concentrations and behavior using adjusted multiple regression interaction models. RESULTS: In boys, concentrations of monoisobutyl phthalate were associated with higher scores for inattention ({$\beta$} = 0.27; 95\% CI: 0.04, 0.50), rule-breaking behavior ({$\beta$} = 0.20; 95\% CI: 0.01, 0.38), aggression ({$\beta$} = 0.34; 95\% CI: 0.09, 0.59), and conduct problems ({$\beta$} = 0.39; 95\% CI: 0.20, 0.58), whereas the molar sum of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolites was associated with higher scores for somatic problems ({$\beta$} = 0.15; 95\% CI: 0.03, 0.28). Higher monobenzyl phthalate concentrations were associated with higher scores for oppositional behavior ({$\beta$} = 0.16; 95\% CI: 0.01, 0.32) and conduct problems ({$\beta$} = 0.21; 95\% CI: 0.06, 0.37) in boys, but with reduced anxiety scores in girls ({$\beta$} = -0.20; 95\% CI: -0.39, -0.01). In general, the associations reported above were close to the null among girls. Model coefficients represent the difference in the square root-transformed outcome score associated with a 1-unit increase in log-transformed metabolites. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest associations between exposure to certain phthalates in late pregnancy and behavioral problems in boys. Given the few studies on this topic and methodological and population differences among studies, additional research is warranted.},

METHODS: Genome-wide 5-hmC levels were measured using hydroxymethylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (HMeDIP-seq). Modeling of differential hydroxymethylation by BPA exposure was performed using a pipeline of bioinformatics tools, including the csaw R package.

Further, the effect of perinatal BPA exposure on 5-hmC at specific imprinted loci indicates that developmental exposure to environmental toxicants may alter long-term imprinted gene regulation via an epigenetic mechanism.  https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP3441},

  abstract = {In modern societies, living organisms are exposed daily to multiform pollution from industrial chemical products. Some of these substances have been shown to affect the endocrine system, and have been termed endocrine disruptors (EDs). Bisphenol A (BPA), which can leach from plastics, and parabens, used in cosmetic products, are among the most well-studied. Prenatal development is a vulnerable phase of human life, and disruptions during this period may have lifelong consequences. Since EDs are known to cross the placental barrier and BPA may accumulate in the fetus, ``BPA-free'' products have been introduced to the market. However, such products often contain alternative bisphenols (e.g. BPS, BPF) that have not yet been extensively examined or regulated. Moreover, alternative bisphenols often occur together with BPA. The human organism is thus exposed to a mixture of EDs, some of which can have additive or synergic effects. Recent findings have also shown that paraben exposure can alter bisphenol pharmacokinetics. Taking into account the widespread occurrence of various EDs and the potential multiplicity of their effects, doses of EDs currently considered safe may not actually be as safe as they appear, especially during pregnancy.},

  abstract = {Background The harmful effects of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) on human health are generally well-known, and exposure during fetal development may have lasting effects. Fetal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) has been recently relatively well-studied; however, less is known about alternatives such as bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol F (BPF) and bisphenol AF (BPAF), which have started to appear in consumer products. Parabens are another widespread group of EDCs, with confirmed transplacental passage. The usage of many cosmetic, pharmaceutical and consumer products during the pregnancy that may contain parabens and bisphenols has led to the need for investigation. Objectives To shed more light into the transplacental transport of BPA, its alternatives, and parabens, and to study their relation to fetal steroidogenesis. Methods BPA, BPS, BPF, BPAF, methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben, benzylparaben and 15 steroids including estrogens, corticoids, androgens and immunomodulatory ones were determined in 27 maternal (37th week of pregnancy) and cord plasma samples using liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry methods. Results In cord blood, significantly higher BPA levels (p=0.0455) were observed compared to maternal plasma. The results from multiple regression models showed that in cord blood, methylparaben ({$\beta$}=-0.027, p=0.027), propylparaben ({$\beta$}=-0.025, p=0.03) and the sum of all measured parabens ({$\beta$}=-0.037, p=0.015) were inversely associated with testosterone levels. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the simultaneous detection of BPA, alternative bisphenols, parabens and steroids in maternal and cord plasma. Our study confirmed the transplacental transport of BPA, with likely accumulation in the fetal compartment. The negative association of cord blood parabens and testosterone levels points to possible risks with respect to importance of testosterone for prenatal male development.},

Prenatal administration of bisphenol A (BPA) induces histologic anomalies in the dorsal telencephalon of the embryo. Whether these anomalies affect the morphogenesis and maturation of neuronal function of the newborn neocortex, however, is unknown. To evaluate the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of prenatal BPA exposure at 20 and 200{$\mu$}g/kg/day in newborn mice, we performed a detailed histologic analysis of the neocortex and tested for the presence of behavioral abnormalities in newborn mice prenatally exposed to BPA using our newly developed behavioral test. Observations of newborn mice prenatally exposed to BPA revealed abnormal neuronal distribution and layer formation, hypoplasia of layer 6b, and abnormal dopaminergic neuronal projections in the neocortex. Further, the newborn mice exhibited hyperactivity. These findings suggest that prenatal BPA exposure induces neurobehavioral toxicity associated with abnormal dopaminergic neuronal projections, and abnormal corticogenesis and lamination. Histologic and behavioral analyses of newborn mice are considered useful for assessing the neurodevelopmental and behavioral toxicity of chemicals.},

Subjects were interviewed using questionnaires regarding their demographic characteristics, educational background, and work and home activities related to pesticide exposures. Spot urine samples were collected at 28 weeks gestation and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine maternal metabolite levels of organophosphate pesticides including dimethyl phosphate (DMP); total DEP (diethyl phosphate (DEP), diethyl thiophosphate (DETP), and diethyl dithiophosphate (DEDTP), and total DAP (the sum of all metabolite levels). At five months of age, infant development was evaluated using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-III (Bayley-III). Higher total DEP and total DAP metabolite levels from the mother at 28 weeks' gestation were significantly associated with reduced motor composite scores on the Bayley-III at five months of age. The total DEP levels were also significantly associated with reduced cognitive composite scores. Prenatal concentrations of maternal urinary metabolites were associated with infant cognitive and motor development. The results of several studies now suggest the need for public health intervention to reduce prenatal pesticide exposures from both agricultural and domestic use.},

  abstract = {Bisphenol A (BPA) belongs to chemicals that are produced in large quantities worldwide. It is commonly used as monomer in polycarbonate synthesis, plasticizer in the production of epoxy resins, as well as an additive for the elimination of surfeit of hydrochloric acid during the polyvinyl chloride (PVC) production. BPA is not only used in the production of plastics intended to a direct contact with food, including plastic packaging and kitchenware, but also in inner coatings of cans and jar caps. There are various routes of human exposure to this substance such as oral, by inhalation and transdermal. The main sources of exposure to BPA include food packaging and dust, dental materials, healthcare equipment, thermal paper, toys and articles for children and infants. BPA is metabolized in the liver to form bisphenol A glucuronide and mostly in this form is excreted with urine. Due to its phenolic structure BPA has been shown to interact with estrogen receptors and to act as agonist or antagonist via estrogen receptor (ER) dependent signalling pathways. Therefore, BPA has been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of several endocrine disorders including female and male infertility, precocious puberty, hormone dependent tumours such as breast and prostate cancer and several metabolic disorders including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Because of the constant, daily exposure and its tendency to bio-accumulation, BPA seems to require special attention such as biomonitoring. This observation should include clinical tests of BPA concentration in the urine, which is not only one of the best methods of evaluation of the exposure to this compound, but also the dependence of the daily intake of BPA and the risk of some endocrine disorders.},

Sample pretreatment starts with dispersive solid phase extraction of POPs to dichloromethane-hexane, which is immediately poured to cleanup column. POPs are eluted from column and concentrated for GC-MS/MS analysis. PFAAs are trapped to dispersant and are then extracted with ammonium acetate in methanol, concentrated and analysed with LC-MS/MS. For POPs, the limit of detection (LOD) ranged from 1.6 to 17pg/ml. Oxychlordane and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane had LODs in the upper end of this range as they were more labile and prone for interferences in the GC-MS/MS. For PFAAs, the LOD range from 0.027 to 0.068ng/ml. For POPs, the accuracy from Standard Reference Materials SRM 1589a and Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) intercalibration samples range from 74 to 127\% and the repeatability (relative standard deviation, RSD\%) from 2.0 to 15\%. For PFAAs, the accuracy from AMAP samples ranged from 90 to 110\% and from LOQ level spiked serum samples from 72 to 133\%.

  abstract = {Mutations in imprinted genes or their imprint control regions (ICRs) produce changes in imprinted gene expression and distinct abnormalities in placental structure, indicating the importance of genomic imprinting to placental development. We have recently shown that a very broad spectrum of placental abnormalities associated with altered imprinted gene expression occurs in the absence of the oocyte-derived DNMT1o cytosine methyltransferase, which normally maintains parent-specific imprinted methylation during preimplantation. The absence of DNMT1o partially reduces inherited imprinted methylation while retaining the genetic integrity of imprinted genes and their ICRs. Using this novel system, we undertook a broad and inclusive approach to identifying key ICRs involved in placental development by correlating loss of imprinted DNA methylation with abnormal placental phenotypes in a mid-gestation window (E12.5-E15.5). To these ends we measured DNA CpG methylation at 15 imprinted gametic differentially methylated domains (gDMDs) that overlap known ICRs using EpiTYPER-mass array technology, and linked these epigenetic measurements to histomorphological defects. Methylation of some imprinted gDMDs, most notably Dlk1, was nearly normal in mid-gestation DNMT1o-deficient placentas, consistent with the notion that cells having lost methylation on these DMDs do not contribute significantly to placental development. Most imprinted gDMDs however showed a wide range of methylation loss among DNMT1o-deficient placentas. Two striking associations were observed. First, loss of DNA methylation at the Peg10 imprinted gDMD associated with decreased embryonic viability and decreased labyrinthine volume. Second, loss of methylation at the Kcnq1 imprinted gDMD was strongly associated with trophoblast giant cell (TGC) expansion. We conclude that the Peg10 and Kcnq1 ICRs are key regulators of mid-gestation placental function.},

In our previous work, we showed that RGMa is significantly upregulated in the substantia nigra of patients with Parkinson's disease. Here we demonstrate the expression of RGMa in midbrain human dopaminergic (DA) neurons. To investigate whether RGMa might model aspects of the neuropathology of Parkinson's disease in mouse, we targeted RGMa to adult midbrain dopaminergic neurons using adeno-associated viral vectors. Overexpression of RGMa resulted in a progressive movement disorder, including motor coordination and imbalance, which is typical for a loss of DA release in the striatum. In line with this, RGMa induced selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and affected the integrity of the nigrostriatal system. The degeneration of dopaminergic neurons was accompanied by a strong microglia and astrocyte activation. The behavioral, molecular, and anatomical changes induced by RGMa in mice are remarkably similar to the clinical and neuropathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease. Our data indicate that dysregulation of RGMa plays an important role in the pathology of Parkinson's disease, and antibody-mediated functional interference with RGMa may be a disease modifying treatment option. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by severe motor dysfunction due to progressive degeneration of mesencephalic dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra. To date, there is no regenerative treatment available. We previously showed that repulsive guidance molecule member a (RGMa) is upregulated in the substantia nigra of PD patients. Adeno-associated virus-mediated targeting of RGMa to mouse DA neurons showed that overexpression of this repulsive axon guidance and cell patterning cue models the behavioral and neuropathological characteristics of PD in a remarkable way. These findings have implications for therapy development as interfering with the function of this specific axon guidance cue may be beneficial to the survival of DA neurons.},

  abstract = {Throughout in utero development, the placenta plays a key role in controlling growth and development. The placenta acts not only as a gatekeeper of nutrient and waste exchange between mother and developing fetus, but also as a regulator of the intrauterine environment. Its functions can be influenced by the environment encountered throughout pregnancy, thereby altering the appropriate genetic programming needed to allow for appropriate fetal growth. Epigenetic alterations related to environmental exposures have been linked to aberrant fetal growth. DNA methylation, which is the best known DNA epigenetic modification, may provide an attractive mechanism linking environmental cues to placental pathology, with consequences for fetal growth and adult life. Alteration of the methylation patterns of genes expressed in the placenta has recently been found to modify gene expression and subsequently impair function of the placenta. Although there is strong evidence to demonstrate that the environment can affect the pattern of DNA methylation of the placenta during fetal development, a direct association between environmental conditions, methylation alterations and gene expression is difficult to confirm. DNA methylation in the placenta has mainly been investigated in the context of imprinted and non-imprinted genes transcription. Several environmental factors have also been assessed in regard to their association with changes to the epigenetic motives of embryonic and extraembryonic tissues and their impact on pregnancy outcome. In this review, we briefly present the available evidence regarding the role of DNA methylation patterns of the placenta on aberrant fetal growth.},

  abstract = {Background: Graphical Gaussian models are popular tools for the estimation of (undirected) gene association networks from microarray data. A key issue when the number of variables greatly exceeds the number of samples is the estimation of the matrix of partial correlations. Since the (Moore-Penrose) inverse of the sample covariance matrix leads to poor estimates in this scenario, standard methods are inappropriate and adequate regularization techniques are needed. Popular approaches include biased estimates of the covariance matrix and highdimensional regression schemes, such as the Lasso and Partial Least Squares. Results: In this article, we investigate a general framework for combining regularized regression methods with the estimation of Graphical Gaussian models. This framework includes various existing methods as well as two new approaches based on ridge regression and adaptive lasso, respectively. These methods are extensively compared both qualitatively and quantitatively within a simulation study and through an application to six diverse real data sets. In addition, all proposed algorithms are implemented in the R package "parcor", available from the R repository CRAN. Conclusion: In our simulation studies, the investigated non-sparse regression methods, i.e. Ridge Regression and Partial Least Squares, exhibit rather conservative behavior when combined with (local) false discovery rate multiple testing in order to decide whether or not an edge is present in the network. For networks with higher densities, the difference in performance of the methods decreases. For sparse networks, we confirm the Lasso's well known tendency towards selecting too many edges, whereas the two-stage adaptive Lasso is an interesting alternative that provides sparser solutions. In our simulations, both sparse and non-sparse methods are able to reconstruct networks with cluster structures. On six real data sets, we also clearly distinguish the results obtained using the non-sparse methods and those obtained using the sparse methods where specification of the regularization parameter automatically means model selection. In five out of six data sets, Partial Least Squares selects very dense networks. Furthermore, for data that violate the assumption of uncorrelated observations (due to replications), the Lasso and the adaptive Lasso yield very complex structures, indicating that they might not be suited under these conditions. The shrinkage approach is more stable than the regression based approaches when using subsampling.},

Methods Prospective study of 183 pregnant women with 2nd trimester serum and urine samples available. Maternal concentrations of the chemical UV filters benzophenone-1 (BP-1) and benzophenone-3 (BP-3) in urine and 4-hydroxy-benzophenone (4-HBP) in serum were measured by liquid chromatography\textendash tandem mass spectrometry (LC\textendash MS/MS). The relationships between 2nd trimester maternal concentrations of the three chemical UV filters and maternal serum concentrations of thyroid hormones and growth factors, as well as birth outcomes (weight, height, and head and abdominal circumferences) were examined. Results Positive associations between maternal serum concentrations of 4-HBP and triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and its binding protein IGFBP3 were observed in mothers carrying male fetuses. Male infants of mothers in the middle 4-HBP exposure group had statistically significantly lower weight and shorter head and abdominal circumferences at birth compared to the low exposure group.

  abstract = {Background Previous studies have demonstrated widespread exposure of humans to certain benzophenones commonly used as UV filters or UV absorbers; some of which have been demonstrated to have endocrine disrupting abilities. Objectives To examine whether benzophenones present in pregnant women pass through the placental barrier to amniotic fluid and further to the fetal blood circulation. Methods A prospective study of 200 pregnant women with simultaneously collected paired samples of amniotic fluid and maternal serum and urine. In addition, unique samples of human fetal blood (n=4) obtained during cordocentesis: and cord blood (n=23) obtained at delivery, both with paired maternal samples of serum and urine collected simultaneously, were used. All biological samples were analyzed by TurboFlow-liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry for seven different benzophenones. Results Benzophenone-1 (BP-1), benzophenone-3 (BP-3), 4-methyl-benzophenone (4-MBP), and 4-hydroxy-benzophenone (4-HBP) were all detectable in amniotic fluid and cord blood samples and except 4-HBP also in fetal blood; albeit at a low frequency. BP-1 and BP-3 were measured at \textasciitilde 10-times lower concentrations in fetal and cord blood compared to maternal serum and 1000-times lower concentration compared to maternal urine levels. Therefore BP-1 and BP-3 were only detectable in the fetal circulation in cases of high maternal exposure indicating some protection by the placental barrier. 4-MBP seems to pass into fetal and cord blood more freely with a median 1:3 ratio between cord blood and maternal serum levels. Only for BP-3, which the women seemed to be most exposed to, did the measured concentrations in maternal urine and serum correlate to concentrations measured in amniotic fluid. Thus, for BP-3, but not for the other tested benzophenones, maternal urinary levels seem to be a valid proxy for fetal exposure. Conclusions Detectable levels of several of the investigated benzophenones in human amniotic fluid as well as in fetal and cord blood calls for further investigations of the toxicokinetic and potential endocrine disrupting properties of these compounds in order for better assessment of the risk to the developing fetus.},

  abstract = {More than half the pregnant women in the Western world report taking mild analgesics. These pharmaceutical compounds have been associated with congenital cryptorchidism in humans, the best-known risk factor for low semen quality and testicular germ cell cancer. Furthermore, some of these mild analgesics exert potent anti-androgenic effects in the male rat and several endocrine-disrupting compounds, known to alter masculinization, have also been shown to be potent inhibitors of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis similar to mild analgesics. Using a 3-day ex vivo organotypic model system based on gestational day 14.5 rat testes, we herein show that testosterone production was inhibited by paracetamol, at doses of 0.1 {$\mu$}m to 100 {$\mu$}m. Similar results were obtained for aspirin (1\textendash 100 {$\mu$}m) and indomethacin (10 {$\mu$}m). The production of the other Leydig cell hormone, Insl3, was not disrupted by exposure to paracetamol. Investigations of the gross anatomy of the testis as well as Leydig cells number and rate of gonocyte apoptosis after the 3 days of ex vivo differentiation showed no significant effect of the analgesics tested compared with controls. These data indicate therefore that mild analgesics specifically inhibit testosterone production in rat foetal testes in vitro and that these compounds had no effect on gonocyte survival. Parallel determinations of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) production indicated that the effects of paracetamol and aspirin on PGD2 and testosterone were not connected, whereas the effects of indomethacin were correlated. We conclude that mild analgesics exert direct and specific anti-androgenic effects in rat foetal testis in our experimental setup and that the mechanism of action is probably uncoupled from the inhibition of PG synthesis.},

  abstract = {Concern has been raised over increased male reproductive disorders in the Western world, and the disruption of male endocrinology has been suggested to play a central role. Several studies have shown that mild analgesics exposure during fetal life is associated with antiandrogenic effects and congenital malformations, but the effects on the adult man remain largely unknown. Through a clinical trial with young men exposed to ibuprofen, we show that the analgesic resulted in the clinical condition named ``compensated hypogonadism," a condition prevalent among elderly men and associated with reproductive and physical disorders. In the men, luteinizing hormone (LH) and ibuprofen plasma levels were positively correlated, and the testosterone/LH ratio decreased. Using adult testis explants exposed or not exposed to ibuprofen, we demonstrate that the endocrine capabilities from testicular Leydig and Sertoli cells, including testosterone production, were suppressed through transcriptional repression. This effect was also observed in a human steroidogenic cell line. Our data demonstrate that ibuprofen alters the endocrine system via selective transcriptional repression in the human testes, thereby inducing compensated hypogonadism.},

Current state-of-the-art methods can yield models with high variance, rendering them unsuitable for a number of practical applications including QSAR. In this paper we describe and evaluate best practices which improve reliability and increase confidence in selected models. A key operational component of the proposed methods is cloud computing which enables routine use of previously infeasible approaches. METHODS: We describe in detail an algorithm for repeated grid-search V-fold cross-validation for parameter tuning in classification and regression, and we define a repeated nested cross-validation algorithm for model assessment. As regards variable selection and parameter tuning we define two algorithms (repeated grid-search cross-validation and double cross-validation), and provide arguments for using the repeated grid-search in the general case. RESULTS: We show results of our algorithms on seven QSAR datasets. The variation of the prediction performance, which is the result of choosing different splits of the dataset in V-fold cross-validation, needs to be taken into account when selecting and assessing classification and regression models. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the importance of repeating cross-validation when selecting an optimal model, as well as the importance of repeating nested cross-validation when assessing a prediction error.},

Here, we analysed the expression of key TSC transcription factors Cdx2, Eomes, and Elf5 in the early developing placenta of mouse embryos and in cultured TSCs and reveal surprising heterogeneity in protein levels. We analysed persistence of TSCs in the early placenta and find that TSCs remain in the chorionic hinge until E9.5 and are lost shortly afterwards. To define the transcriptional signature of bona fide TSCs, we used inducible gain- and loss-of-function alleles of Eomes or Cdx2, and Eomes (GFP), to manipulate and monitor the core maintenance factors of TSCs, followed by genome-wide expression profiling. Combinatorial analysis of resulting expression profiles allowed for defining novel TSC marker genes that might functionally contribute to the maintenance of the TSC state. Analyses by qRT-PCR and in situ hybridisation validated novel TSC- and chorion-specific marker genes, such as Bok/Mtd, Cldn26, Duox2, Duoxa2, Nr0b1, and Sox21. Thus, these expression data provide a valuable resource for the transcriptional signature of bona fide and early differentiating TSCs and may contribute to an increased understanding of the transcriptional circuitries that maintain and/or establish stemness of TSCs.},

  abstract = {Bisphenol A (BPA) is an estrogenic environmental toxin widely used in the production of plastics and ubiquitous human exposure to this chemical has been proposed to be a potential risk to public health. Animal studies suggest that in utero and early postnatal exposure to this compound may produce a broad range of adverse effects, including impaired brain development, sexual differentiation, behavior, and immune function, which could extend to future generations. Molecular mechanisms that underlie the long-lasting effects of BPA continue to be elucidated, and likely involve disruption of epigenetic programming of gene expression during development. Several studies have provided evidence that maternal exposure to BPA results in postnatal changes in DNA methylation status and altered expression of specific genes in offspring. However, further studies are needed to extend these initial findings to other genes in different tissues, and to examine the correlations between BPA-induced epigenetic alterations, changes in gene expression, and various phenotypic outcomes. It will be also important to explore whether the epigenetic effects of BPA are related to its estrogenic activity, and to determine which downstream effector proteins could mediate changes in DNA methylation. In this review, we will highlight research indicating a consequence of prenatal BPA exposure for brain, behavior, and immune outcomes and discuss evidence for the role of epigenetic pathways in shaping these developmental effects. Based on this evidence, we will suggest future directions in the study of BPA-induced epigenetic effects and discuss the transgenerational implications of exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals.},

  abstract = {Early-life adversity increases the risk for psychopathology in later life. The underlying mechanism(s) is unknown, but epigenetic variation represents a plausible candidate. Early-life exposures can disrupt epigenetic programming in the brain, with lasting consequences for gene expression and behavior. This evidence is primarily derived from animal studies, with limited study in humans due to inaccessibility of the target brain tissue. In humans, although there is evidence for DNA methylation changes in the peripheral blood of psychiatric patients, a fundamental question remains as to whether epigenetic markers in the blood can predict epigenetic changes occurring in the brain. We used in utero bisphenol A (BPA) exposure as a model environmental exposure shown to disrupt neurodevelopment and exert long-term effects on behavior in animals and humans. We show that prenatal BPA induces lasting DNA methylation changes in the transcriptionally relevant region of the               Bdnf               gene in the hippocampus and blood of BALB/c mice and that these changes are consistent with               BDNF               changes in the cord blood of humans exposed to high maternal BPA levels in utero. Our data suggest that               BDNF               DNA methylation in the blood may be used as a predictor of brain               BDNF               DNA methylation and gene expression as well as behavioral vulnerability induced by early-life environmental exposure.

The study of exact mechanisms is very complicated because both genetic and environmental factors contribute to this complex disease. The ability of environmental factors to promote phenotype changes by epigenetic DNA modifications (i.e. DNA methylation, histone modifications) was demonstrated to play an important role in the development and predisposition to particular symptoms of metabolic syndrome. There is no doubt that the early life, such as the fetal and perinatal periods, is critical for metabolic syndrome development and therefore critical for prevention of this disease. Moreover, these changes are visible not only in individuals exposed to environmental factors but also in the subsequent progeny for multiple generations and this phenomenon is called transgenerational inheritance. The knowledge of molecular mechanisms, by which early minor environmental stimuli modify the expression of genetic information, might be the desired key for the understanding of mechanisms leading to the change of phenotype in adulthood. This review provides a short overview of metabolic syndrome epigenetics.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) is associated with allergy, chronic inflammation, and immunodeficiency. Phthalates, the common EDCs used in plastic industry, may act as adjuvants to disrupt immune system and enhance allergy. Plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) are predominant cells secreting type I interferon (IFN) against infection and are professional antigen-presenting cells in regulating adaptive immunity. However, the effects of phthalates on the function of pDCs are unknown. METHODS: Circulating pDCs were isolated from healthy subjects, were pretreated with diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) and butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), and were stimulated with Toll-like receptor (TLR)-9 agonist CpG. IFN-{$\alpha$}/IFN-{$\beta$} levels, surface markers, and T-cell stimulatory function were investigated using ELISA, flow cytometry, and pDC/T-cell coculture assay. Mechanisms were investigated using receptor antagonists, pathway inhibitors, Western blotting, and chromatin immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: Diethylhexyl phthalate and butyl benzyl phthalate suppressed CpG-induced IFN-{$\alpha$}/IFN-{$\beta$} expression in pDCs, and the effect was reversed by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) antagonist. Diethylhexyl phthalate suppressed CpG-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-MEK1/2-ERK-ELK1 and NF{$\kappa$}B signaling pathways. Diethylhexyl phthalate suppressed CpG-induced interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-7 expression by suppressing histone H3K4 trimethylation at IRF7 gene promoter region through inhibiting translocation of H3K4-specific trimethyltransferase WDR5 from cytoplasm into nucleus. Butyl benzyl phthalate or diethylhexyl phthalate-treated pDCs suppressed IFN-{$\gamma$} but enhanced IL-13 production by CD4+ T cells. CONCLUSION: Phthalates may interfere with immunity against infection and promote the deviation of Th2 response to increase allergy by acting on human pDCs via suppressing IFN-{$\alpha$}/IFN-{$\beta$} expression and modulating the ability to stimulate T-cell responses.},

  abstract = {Mechanisms underlying adverse birth and later in life health effects from exposure to air pollution during the prenatal period have not been not fully elucidated, especially in the context of mixtures. We assessed the effects of prenatal exposure to mixtures of air pollutants of particulate matter (PM), PM2.5, PM10, nitrogen oxides, NO2, NO                         x                     , ultrafine particles (UFP), and oxidative potential (OP) of PM2.5 on infant birthweight in four European birth cohorts and the mechanistic underpinnings through cross-omics of metabolites and inflammatory proteins. The association between mixtures of air pollutants and birthweight z-scores (standardized for gestational age) was assessed for three different mixture models, using Bayesian machine kernel regression (BKMR). We determined the direct effect for PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and mediation by cross-omic signatures (identified using sparse partial least-squares regression) using causal mediation BKMR models. There was a negative association with birthweight z-scores and exposure to mixtures of air pollutants, where up to -0.21 or approximately a 96 g decrease in birthweight, comparing the 75th percentile to the median level of exposure to the air pollutant mixture could occur. Shifts in birthweight z-scores from prenatal exposure to PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 were mediated by molecular mechanisms, represented by cross-omics scores. Interleukin-17 and epidermal growth factor were identified as important inflammatory responses underlyingair pollution-associated shifts in birthweight. Our results signify that by identifying mechanisms through which mixtures of air pollutants operate, the causality of air pollution-associated shifts in birthweight is better supported, substantiating the need for reducing exposure in vulnerable populations.},

There has been a revolution in DNA methylation analysis technology over the past decade: analyses that previously were restricted to specific loci can now be performed on a genome-scale and entire methylomes can be characterized at single-base-pair resolution. However, there is such a diversity of DNA methylation profiling techniques that it can be challenging to select one.

With the rise of the internet it has become easier to preregister the theoretical and empirical basis for predictions, the experimental design, the materials, and the analysis code. Whether the practice of preregistration is valuable depends on your philosophy of science. Here, I provide a conceptual analysis of the value of preregistration for psychological science from an error statistical philosophy (Mayo, 2018). Preregistration has the goal to allow others to transparently evaluate the capacity of a test to falsify a prediction, or the severity of a test. Researchers who aim to test predictions with severity should find value in the practice of preregistration. I differentiate the goal of preregistration from positive externalities, discuss how preregistration itself does not make a study better or worse compared to a non-preregistered study, and highlight the importance of evaluating the usefulness of a tool such as preregistration based on an explicit consideration of your philosophy of science.},

We previously showed that alterations of the placental imprinted gene expression are associated with suboptimal perinatal growth and respond to environmental stimuli including socio-economic determinants. At the same time, maternal psychosocial stress during pregnancy (MPSP) has been shown to affect fetal growth. Here, we set out to test the hypothesis that placental imprinted gene expression mediates the effects of MPSP on fetal growth in a well-characterized birth cohort, the Stress in Pregnancy (SIP) Study. We observed that mothers experiencing high MPSP deliver infants with lower birthweight (P=0.047). Among the 109 imprinted genes tested, we detected panels of placental imprinted gene expression of 23 imprinted genes associated with MPSP and 26 with birthweight. Among these genes, five imprinted genes (CPXM2, glucosidase alpha acid (GAA), GPR1, SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 2 (SHANK2) and THSD7A) were common to the two panels. In multivariate analyses, controlling for maternal age and education and gestational age at birth and infant gender, two genes, GAA and SHANK2, each showed a 22\% mediation of MPSP on fetal growth. These data provide new insights into the role that imprinted genes play in translating the maternal stress message into a fetoplacental growth pattern.},

  abstract = {Triclosan (TCS) is considered a potent endocrine disruptor that causes reproductive toxicity in non-mammals, but it is still unclear exactly whether TCS has adverse effects on the sperm or reproductive organs in mammals. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the distribution status of TCS in male reproductive organs of rats, and seek the correlation with the TCS-induced sperm toxicity or reproductive organ damage. Male rats were intragastrically administered with TCS at a dose of 50 mg/kg, the kinetics of TCS in the plasma and reproductive organs were investigated. TCS in testes and prostates both showed a lower-level distritbution compared to that in the plasma, which indicates it has no tendency to accumulate in those organs. However, TCS in the epididymides showed a longer elimination half-life (t1/2z), a longer the mean retention time (MRT), and a lower clearance (CLZ/F) compared with those in the plasma. Besides, the ratios of mean area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)0\textendash 96h(epididymides/plasma) and AUC0\textendash{$\infty$}(epididymides/plasma) were 1.13 and 1.51, respectively. These kinetic parameters suggest TCS has an accumulation tendency in the epididymides. Based on this, we investigated the TCS-induced sperm toxicity and histopathological changes of reproductive organs in rats. TCS was given intragastrically at doses of 10, 50, and 200 mg/kg for 8 weeks. Rats treated with the high dose (200 mg/kg) of TCS showed a significant decrease in daily sperm production (DSP), changes in sperm morphology and epididymal histopathology. Considering the histopathological change in the epididymides, TCS may induce the epididymal damage due to the epididymal accumulation of that. \textcopyright{} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is increasing concern that early-life exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can influence the risk of disease development. Phthalates and phenols are two classes of suspected EDCs that are used in a variety of everyday consumer products, including plastics, epoxy resins, and cosmetics. In utero exposure to EDCs may affect disease propensity through epigenetic mechanisms. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether prenatal exposure to multiple EDCs is associated with changes in miRNA expression of human placenta, and whether miRNA alterations are associated with birth outcomes. METHODS: Our study was restricted to a total of 179 women co-enrolled in the Harvard Epigenetic Birth Cohort and the Predictors of Preeclampsia Study. We analyzed associations between first-trimester urine concentrations of 8 phenols and 11 phthalate metabolites and expression of 29 candidate miRNAs in placenta by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: For three miRNAs--miR-142-3p, miR15a-5p, and miR-185--we detected associations between {$\Sigma$}phthalates or {$\Sigma$}phenols on expression levels (p {$<$} 0.05). By assessing gene ontology enrichment, we determined the potential mRNA targets of these microRNAs predicted in silico were associated with several biological pathways, including the regulation of protein serine/threonine kinase activity. Four gene ontology biological processes were enriched among genes significantly correlated with the expression of miRNAs associated with EDC burden. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results suggest that prenatal phenol and phthalate exposure is associated with altered miRNA expression in placenta, suggesting a potential mechanism of EDC toxicity in humans.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Triclosan (TCS) is widely used as an antibacterial agent in consumer products such as hand soap and toothpaste, and human exposure is widespread. TCS is suspected of having endocrine-disrupting properties, but few human studies have examined the developmental effects of prenatal TCS exposure. OBJECTIVES: We prospectively examined associations between prenatal TCS exposure and anthropometric measures at birth and anogenital distance (AGD) at 3 months of age. METHODS: Pregnant women from the Odense Child Cohort (n = 514) provided urine samples at approximately gestational week 28 (median 28.7 weeks, range 26.4-34.0), and urinary TCS concentration was measured by isotope dilution TurboFlow-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine associations between prenatal TCS exposure and measures of size at birth (birth weight, length, head and abdominal circumference) and AGD at 3 months of age (median 3.3 months, range 2.3-6.7 months), controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: Newborn boys in the highest quartile of prenatal TCS exposure had a 0.7-cm [95\% confidence interval (CI): -1.2, -0.1, p = 0.01] smaller head circumference than boys in the lowest quartile. Additionally in boys, inverse associations of borderline statistical significance were observed between prenatal TCS exposure and abdominal circumference at birth and AGD at 3 months of age (p-values {$<$} 0.10). Prenatal TCS exposure was not significantly associated with any of the outcomes in girls. However, AGD was measured in fewer girls, and we observed no significant interactions between a child's sex and prenatal TCS exposure in anthropometric measures at birth. CONCLUSION: Prenatal TCS exposure was associated with reduced head and abdominal circumference at birth and with reduced AGD at 3 months of age in boys, although the last two findings were statistically nonsignificant. These findings require replication but are compatible with an anti-androgenic effect of prenatal TCS exposure on fetal growth in boys.

Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is the most abundant phthalate in the environment. Humans are exposed to these compounds through ingestion, inhalation, and dermal exposure for their whole lifetime, since the intrauterine life. Public and scientific concern has increased in recent years about the potential health risks associated with exposure to phthalates. The main focus has moved away from the hepatotoxic effects to the endocrine disrupting potency of these chemicals. To date, although the consistent toxicologic data on phthalates is suggestive, information on sources and pathways of human exposure to phthalates is limited. Recently, exposure to phthalates has been assessed by analyzing urine for their metabolites. This approach is contrary to the determination of the parent phthalates in air, water and foodstuff and not subject to contamination. Furthermore, these metabolites and the parent phthalates are considered the toxic species. However, accurate methods and models for measuring the amount of phthalates absorbed by the various pathways of exposure have to be developed. In fact, a frequent biological monitoring of phthalates in body fluids and tissues would be highly advisable, both in helping physicians to perform health risk assessments for exposure in the general population and in guiding governments to provide regulations concerning the maximum allowed concentrations in the environment, plasticized products, medications and medical equipment.},

This prospective birth cohort study probed the previously observed association between in utero exposure to acetaminophen and neurodevelopment by using concentrations of acetaminophen measured in meconium, which more objectively captures exposure of the fetus than maternal report. Exposure, measured by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, was categorized into nondetection, low detection, and high detection levels. At age 6\textendash 8 years, children completed a set of subtests from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th edition. Additionally, this study examined potential effect modification by child sex on the association between acetaminophen exposure and neurodevelopment. In fully adjusted models, in utero exposure to acetaminophen was not statistically significantly associated with decreased scores on any of the examined subtests in all children combined (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 118). The effect of in utero acetaminophen exposure on the Coding subtest was marginally significantly different among boys and girls, with girls performing significantly better on the task with higher levels of acetaminophen compared with girls with undetectable levels of exposure (bgirls, low {$\frac{1}{4}$} 2.83 [0.97, 4.70], bgirls, high {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1.95 [\`A0.03, 3.93], bboys, low {$\frac{1}{4}$} .02 [\`A1.78, 1.81], bboys, high {$\frac{1}{4}$} \`A.39 [\`A2.09, 1.31], pinteraction {$\frac{1}{4}$} .06).

In this workflow article, we analyse RNA-sequencing data from the mouse mammary gland, demonstrating use of the popular               edgeR               package to import, organise, filter and normalise the data, followed by the               limma               package with its               voom               method, linear modelling and empirical Bayes moderation to assess differential expression and perform gene set testing. This pipeline is further enhanced by the               Glimma               package which enables interactive exploration of the results so that individual samples and genes can be examined by the user. The complete analysis offered by these three packages highlights the ease with which researchers can turn the raw counts from an RNA-sequencing experiment into biological insights using Bioconductor.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposures to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during critical developmental windows have been implicated in the etiologies of a wide array of adverse perinatal and pediatric outcomes. Epidemiological studies have concentrated on the health effects of individual chemicals, despite the understanding that EDCs act together via common mechanisms, that pregnant women are exposed to multiple EDCs simultaneously, and that substantial toxicological evidence of adverse developmental effects has been documented. There is a move toward multipollutant models in environmental epidemiology; however, there is no current consensus on appropriate statistical methods. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to review the statistical methods used in these studies, to identify additional applicable methods, and to determine the strengths and weaknesses of each method for addressing the salient statistical and epidemiological challenges. METHODS: We searched Embase, MEDLINE, and Web of Science for epidemiological studies of endocrine-sensitive outcomes in the children of mothers exposed to EDC mixtures during pregnancy and identified alternative statistical methods from the wider literature. DISCUSSION: We identified 74 studies and analyzed the methods used to estimate mixture health effects, identify important mixture components, account for nonmonotonicity in exposure\textendash response relationships, assess interactions, and identify windows of exposure susceptibility. We identified both frequentist and Bayesian methods that are robust to multicollinearity, performing shrinkage, variable selection, dimension reduction, statistical learning, or smoothing, including methods that were not used by the studies included in our review. CONCLUSIONS: Compelling motivation exists for analyzing EDCs as mixtures, yet many studies make simplifying assumptions about EDC additivity, relative potency, and linearity, or overlook the potential for bias due to asymmetries in chemical persistence. We discuss the potential impacts of these choices and suggest alternative methods to improve analyses of prenatal exposure to EDC mixtures. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2207},

Non-monotonic relationships are increasingly recognised (e.g., for endocrine-disrupting chemicals); however, the impact of nonmonotonicity on exposure selection has not been evaluated. In a simulation study, we assessed the performance of Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), Bayesian additive regression trees (BART), Bayesian structured additive regression with spike\textendash slab priors (BSTARSS), and lasso penalised regression. We used data on exposure to 12 phthalates and phenols in pregnant women from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to simulate realistic exposure data using a multivariate copula. We simulated datasets of size N = 250 and compared methods across 32 scenarios, varying by model size and sparsity, signal-to-noise ratio, correlation structure, and exposure\textendash response relationship shapes. We compared methods in terms of their sensitivity, specificity, and estimation accuracy. In most scenarios, BKMR and BSTARSS achieved moderate to high specificity (0.56\textendash 0.91 and 0.57\textendash 0.96, respectively) and sensitivity (0.49\textendash 0.98 and 0.25\textendash 0.97, respectively). BART achieved high specificity ({$\geq$} 0.96), but low to moderate sensitivity (0.13\textendash 0.66). Lasso was highly sensitive (0.75\textendash 0.99), except for symmetric inverse-U-shaped relationships ({$\leq$} 0.2). Performance was affected by the signal-to-noise ratio, but not substantially by the correlation structure. Penalised regression methods that assume linearity, such as lasso, may not be suitable for studies of environmental chemicals hypothesised to have non-monotonic relationships with outcomes. Instead, BKMR and BSTARSS are attractive methods for flexibly estimating the shapes of exposure\textendash response relationships and selecting among correlated exposures.},

  abstract = {Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are lipophilic compounds that travel with lipids and accumulate mainly in adipose tissue. Recent human evidence links low-dose POPs to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Because humans are contaminated by POP mixtures and POPs possibly have nonmonotonic dose-response relations with T2D, critical methodological issues arise in evaluating human findings. This review summarizes epidemiological results on chlorinated POPs and T2D, and relevant experimental evidence. It also discusses how features of POPs can affect inferences in humans. The evidence as a whole suggests that, rather than a few individual POPs, background exposure to POP mixtures-including organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls-can increase T2D risk in humans. Inconsistent statistical significance for individual POPs may arise due to distributional differences in POP mixtures among populations. Differences in the observed shape of the dose-response curves among human studies may reflect an inverted U-shaped association secondary to mitochondrial dysfunction or endocrine disruption. Finally, we examine the relationship between POPs and obesity. There is evidence in animal studies that low-dose POP mixtures are obesogenic. However, relationships between POPs and obesity in humans have been inconsistent. Adipose tissue plays a dual role of promoting T2D and providing a relatively safe place to store POPs. Large prospective studies with serial measurements of a broad range of POPs, adiposity, and clinically relevant biomarkers are needed to disentangle the interrelationships among POPs, obesity, and the development of T2D. Also needed are laboratory experiments that more closely mimic real-world POP doses, mixtures, and exposure duration in humans.},

  abstract = {Although low doses of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), strong lipophilic chemicals with long half-lives, have been linked to various endocrine, immune, nervous and reproductive system diseases, few obesity studies have considered adipose tissue as an important POPs exposure source. Because the toxicodynamics of POPs relate directly to the dynamics of adiposity, POPs might explain puzzling findings in obesity research. In two people exposed to the same amounts of environmental POPs, the one having more adipose tissue may be advantaged because POPs storage in adipose tissue can reduce burden on other critical organs. Therefore, adipose tissue can play a protective role against the POPs effects. However, two situations increase the POPs release from adipose tissue into the circulation, thereby increasing the risk that they will reach critical organs: (i) weight loss and (ii) insulin resistance. In contrast, weight gain reduces this possibility. Therefore, avoiding harmful health effects of POPs may mostly contradict conventional judgments about obesity and weight change. These contradictory situations can explain the obesity paradox, the adverse effects of intensive intentional weight loss and the protective effects of obesity against dementia. Future studies should consider that adipose tissue is widely contaminated with POPs in modern society.},

Here, we investigated a novel noncoding RNA that has been known as precursor microRNA miR-886 (pre-miR-886). Pre-miR-886 has been proposed also as a vault RNA, a component of the vault complex implicated in cancer drug resistance. We identified pre-miR-886 as a 102-nucleotide-long, abundant cytoplasmic RNA that is neither a genuine pre-microRNA nor a vault RNA. Pre-miR-886 is physically associated with PKR (Protein Kinase RNA-activated), an interferon-inducible and double-stranded RNA dependent kinase. The suppression of pre-miR-886 activates PKR and its downstream pathways, eIF2a phosphorylation and the NF-kB pathway, leading to impaired cell proliferation. We also found that pre-miR-886 is suppressed in a wide-range of cancer cell lines and in clinical specimens. This study is the first intense characterization of pre-miR886 as well as the initial report on its function as a PKR regulator, which suggests a critical role in tumorigenesis.},

Widespread exposure to BPA has created a great deal of concern regarding its potential adverse effects on human health. This study examined the relationship between prenatal BPA exposure and birth outcomes, including birth weight, birth length, and ponderal index considering gender difference. A multi-center birth cohort study, Mothers and Children's Environmental Health (MOCEH) has been established in Korea since 2006. Study subjects are 757 pregnant women from the original cohort, who had their urinary BPA level measured during the third trimester, as well as information on birth outcome, prior medical history, psychosocial status, health behavior, environmental exposure as well as socio-demographic characteristics. Regression analysis was performed to assess the effect of BPA on birth outcome. The geometric mean concentration of BPA in pregnant women was 1.29{$\mu$}g/L (1.87{$\mu$}g/g creatinine) during late pregnancy. Urinary BPA concentrations were shown to be higher in women with a higher income level. Univariate regression analysis revealed a significant association between BPA levels and birth weight. In adjusted analysis, the second tertile of maternal BPA exposure exhibited an increase in birth weight, relative to the first tertile (p=0.04). These relationships were more pronounced in male neonates. Also, prenatal exposure to BPA was associated with an increase of ponderal index in total, and especially female neonates. This study shows that the association of prenatal exposure to BPA with anthropometric measures, such as birth weight and birth length, differed by gender. Further study is required to more fully elaborate this relationship between prenatal BPA exposure and birth outcome.},

Using substantially more DNAm arrays (n=1,102 in the training set) than a previous study, we present three new placental epigenetic clocks: 1) a robust placental clock (RPC) which is unaffected by common pregnancy complications (e.g., gestational diabetes, preeclampsia), and 2) a control placental clock (CPC) constructed using placental samples from pregnancies without known placental pathology, and 3) a refined RPC for uncomplicated term pregnancies. These placental clocks are highly accurate estimators of GA based on placental tissue; e.g., predicted GA based on RPC is highly correlated with actual GA (r{$>$}0.95 in test data, median error less than one week). We show that epigenetic clocks derived from cord blood or other tissues do not accurately estimate GA in placental samples. While fundamentally different from Horvath's pan-tissue epigenetic clock, placental clocks closely track fetal age during development and may have interesting applications.},

Methods to detect differentially methylated regions (DMRs) (clusters of neighboring probes associated with a phenotype) may provide more power to detect associations between DNA methylation and diseases or phenotypes of interest. Results: We proposed a novel approach, GlobalP, and perform comparisons with 3 methods\textemdash DMRcate, Bumphunter, and comb-p\textemdash to identify DMRs associated with log triglycerides (TGs) in real GAW20 data before and after fenofibrate treatment. We applied these methods to the summary statistics from an EWAS performed on the methylation data. Comb-p, DMRcate, and GlobalP detected very similar DMRs near the gene CPT1A on chromosome 11 in both the preand posttreatment data. In addition, GlobalP detected 2 DMRs before fenofibrate treatment in the genes ETV6 and ABCG1. Bumphunter identified several DMRs on chromosomes 1 and 20, which did not overlap with DMRs detected by other methods.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Some legacy and emerging environmental contaminants are suspected risk factors for intrauterine growth restriction. However, the evidence is equivocal, in part due to difficulties in disentangling the effects of mixtures. OBJECTIVES: We assessed associations between multiple correlated biomarkers of environmental exposure and birth weight. METHODS: We evaluated a cohort of 1,250 term ({$\geq$} 37 weeks gestation) singleton infants, born to 513 mothers from Greenland, 180 from Poland, and 557 from Ukraine, who were recruited during antenatal care visits in 2002-2004. Secondary metabolites of diethylhexyl and diisononyl phthalates (DEHP, DiNP), eight perfluoroalkyl acids, and organochlorines (PCB-153 and p,p\textasciiacute -DDE) were quantifiable in 72-100\% of maternal serum samples. We assessed associations between exposures and term birth weight, adjusting for co-exposures and covariates, including prepregnancy body mass index. To identify independent associations, we applied the elastic net penalty to linear regression models. RESULTS: Two phthalate metabolites (MEHHP, MOiNP), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and p,p\textasciiacute -DDE were most consistently predictive of term birth weight based on elastic net penalty regression. In an adjusted, unpenalized regression model of the four exposures, 2-SD increases in natural log\textendash transformed MEHHP, PFOA, and p,p\textasciiacute -DDE were associated with lower birth weight: \textendash 87 g (95\% CI: \textendash 137, \textendash 340 per 1.70 ng/mL), \textendash 43 g (95\% CI: \textendash 108, 23 per 1.18 ng/mL), and \textendash 135 g (95\% CI: \textendash 192, \textendash 78 per 1.82 ng/g lipid), respectively; and MOiNP was associated with higher birth weight (46 g; 95\% CI: \textendash 5, 97 per 2.22 ng/mL). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that several of the environmental contaminants, belonging to three chemical classes, may be independently associated with impaired fetal growth. These results warrant follow-up in other cohorts.},

  abstract = {Background: Numerous ubiquitous environmental chemicals are established or suspected neurotoxicants, and infants are exposed to a mixture of these during the critical period of brain maturation. However, evidence for associations with the risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is sparse. We investigated early-life chemical exposures in relation to ADHD. Methods: We used a birth cohort of 2606 Norwegian mother\textendash child pairs enrolled 2002\textendash 2009 (HUMIS), and studied a subset of 1199 pairs oversampled for child neurodevelopmental outcomes. Concentrations of 27 persistent organic pollutants (14 polychlorinated biphenyls, 5 organochlorine pesticides, 6 brominated flame retardants, and 2 perfluoroalkyl substances) were measured in breast milk, reflecting the child's early-life exposures. We estimated postnatal exposures in the first 2 years of life using a pharmacokinetic model. Fifty-five children had a clinical diagnosis of ADHD (hyperkinetic disorder) by 2016, at a median age of 13 years. We used elastic net penalized logistic regression models to identify associations while adjusting for co-exposure confounding, and subsequently used multivariable logistic regression models to obtain effect estimates for the selected exposures. Results: Breast milk concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and {$\beta$}-hexachlorocyclohexane ({$\beta$}-HCH) were associated with increased odds of ADHD: odds ratio (OR) = 1.77, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.16, 2.72 and OR = 1.75, 95\% CI: 1.22, 2.53, per interquartile range increase in ln-transformed concentrations, respectively. Stronger associations were observed among girls than boys for PFOS (pinteraction = 0.025). p,p{${'}$}-Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p{${'}$}-DDT) levels were associated with lower odds of ADHD (OR = 0.64, 95\% CI: 0.42, 0.97). Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) had a non-linear association with ADHD, with increasing risk in the low-level exposure range that switched to a decreasing risk at concentrations above 8 ng/g lipid. Postnatal exposures showed similar results, whereas effect estimates for other chemicals were weaker and imprecise. Conclusions: In a multi-pollutant analysis of four classes of chemicals, early-life exposure to {$\beta$}-HCH and PFOS was associated with increased risk of ADHD, with suggestion of sex-specific effects for PFOS. The unexpected inverse associations between p,p{${'}$}-DDT and higher HCB levels and ADHD could be due to live birth bias; alternatively, results may be due to chance findings.},

  abstract = {Background: It is of interest to know whether early pregnancy exposure to phenols such as bisphenol-A (BPA) or triclosan (TCS) negatively impacts birth weight outcomes. Exposure to these chemicals is widespread in the Canadian population but obtaining accurate measurements of average exposure is difficult because these chemicals are rapidly excreted from the body, causing body levels to fluctuate both within and between days, as observed in a recent Canadian study (P4). This measurement error can attenuate the estimated effects of exposures. Methods: Data from two Canadian cohort studies, the Plastics and Personal-care Products use in Pregnancy (P4) Study and the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) Study, such that all participants with complete BPA or TCS exposure and outcome data were used (MIREC n = 1822, P4 n = 68). We used regression calibration to correct for the attenuating effects of exposure measurement error when modeling the effect of first trimester BPA or TCS exposure on four birth weight outcomes: birth weight (BW), low birth weight (LBW), small for gestational age (SGA) and large for gestational age (LGA). Specific gravity, time of day, and time since last urine void were also controlled in the analysis. Results: TCS exposure has a marginally significant association with SGA only with odds ratio 0.87 and 95\% confidence interval (0.74, 1.00). It also has a marginally significant association with LGA in male offspring with odds ratio 1.11 and 95\% confidence interval (1.00, 1.25). The effects of BPA on the four birth outcomes were insignificant. Conclusions: Increased TCS exposure during pregnancy is marginally associated with decreased odds of having SGA offspring. It is possibly associated with decreased BW in males and decreased odds of LBW, though these associations were not present in measurement error corrected models. TCS is possibly associated with increased odds in male offspring of being LGA, though this relationship was not present in models not corrected for measurement error. The study finds no significant effects of BPA on birth weight outcomes, which may be due to more severe measurement error in a single observation of BPA.},

  abstract = {The placenta is the principal regulator of the in utero environment, and disruptions to this environment can result in adverse offspring health outcomes. To better characterize the impact of in utero perturbations, we assessed the influence of known environmental pollutants on the expression of microRNA (miRNA) in placental samples collected from the National Children's Study (NCS) Vanguard birth cohort. This study analyzed the expression of 654 miRNAs in 110 term placentas. Environmental pollutants measured in these placentas included dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), bisphenol A (BPA), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), and cadmium (Cd). A moderated t-test was used to identify a panel of differentially expressed miRNAs, which were further analyzed using generalized linear models. We observed 112 miRNAs consistently expressed in {$>$}70\% of the samples. Consistent with the literature, miRNAs located within the imprinted placenta-specific C19MC cluster, specifically mir-517a, mir-517c, mir-522, and mir-23a, are among the top expressed miRNA in our study. We observed a positive association between PBDE 209 and miR-188-5p and an inverse association between PBDE 99 and let-7c. Both PCBs and Cd were positively associated with miR-1537 expression level. In addition, multiple let-7 family members were downregulated with increasing levels of Hg and Pb. We did not observe DDE or BPA levels to be associated with placental miRNA expression. This is the first birth cohort study linking environmental pollutants and placental expression of miRNAs. Our results suggest that placental miRNA profiles may signal in utero exposures to environmental chemicals.},

  abstract = {Correlated multiple testing is widely performed in genetic research, particularly in multilocus analyses of complex diseases. Failure to control appropriately for the effect of multiple testing will either result in a flood of false-positive claims or in true hits being overlooked. Cheverud proposed the idea of adjusting correlated tests as if they were independent, according to an 'effective number' (M(eff)) of independent tests. However, our experience has indicated that Cheverud's estimate of the Meff is overly large and will lead to excessively conservative results. We propose a more accurate estimate of the M(eff), and design M(eff)-based procedures to control the experiment-wise significant level and the false discovery rate. In an evaluation, based on both real and simulated data, the M(eff)-based procedures were able to control the error rate accurately and consequently resulted in a power increase, especially in multilocus analyses. The results confirm that the M(eff) is a useful concept in the error-rate control of correlated tests. With its efficiency and accuracy, the M(eff) method provides an alternative to computationally intensive methods such as the permutation test.},

  abstract = {Cellular immortalization is one of the prerequisite steps in carcinogenesis. By gene expression profiling, we have found that genes in the interferon (IFN) pathway were dysregulated during the spontaneous cellular immortalization of fibroblasts from Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) patients with germ-line mutations in p53. IFN signaling pathway genes were down-regulated by epigenetic silencing during immortalization, and some of these same IFN-regulated genes were activated during replicative senescence. Bisulfite sequencing of the promoter regions of two IFN regulatory transcription factors (IRF5 and IRF7) revealed that IRF7, but not IRF5, was epigenetically silenced by methylation of CpG islands in immortal LFS cells. The induction of IRF7 gene by IFNalpha in immortal LFS cells was potentiated by pretreatment with the demethylation agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Overexpression of IRF5 and IRF7 revealed that they can act either alone or in tandem to activate other IFN-regulated genes. In addition, they serve to inhibit the proliferation rate and induce a senescence-related phenotype in immortal LFS cells. Furthermore, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid treatment of the IRF-overexpressing cells showed a more rapid induction of several IFN-regulated genes. We conclude that the epigenetic inactivation of the IFN pathway plays a critical role in cellular immortalization, and the reactivation of IFN-regulated genes by transcription factors IRF5 and/or IRF7 is sufficient to induce cellular senescence. The IFN pathway may provide valuable molecular targets for therapeutic interventions at early stages of cancer development.},

  abstract = {Defective IFN signaling results in loss of innate immunity and sensitizes cells to enhanced cytolytic killing after Vesticular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) infection. Examination of the innate immunity status of normal human bronchial epithelial cells Beas2B and 7 lung cancer cells revealed that the abrogation of IFN signaling in cancer cells is associated with greater sensitivity to VSV infection. The disruption of the IFN pathway in lung cancer cell lines and primary tumor tissues is caused by epigenetic silencing of critical interferon responsive transcription factors IRF7 and/or IRF5. Although 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment fails to reactivate IRF7 and IRF5 expression or protect cells from VSV infection, manipulating IFN signaling by altering IRF expression changes the viral susceptibility of these cells. Lung cancer cells can be partially protected from viral killing using IRF5+IRF7 overexpression, whereas IFN pathway disruption by transfection of siRNAs to IRF5+IRF7 increases cells' vulnerability to viral infection. Therefore, IRF5 and IRF7 are key transcription factors in IFN pathway that determine viral sensitivity of lung cancer cells; the epigenetically impaired IFN pathway in lung cancer tissues provides potential biomarkers for successful selective killing of cancer cells by oncolytic viral therapy.},

  abstract = {There is a growing concern about the potential health effects of exposure to various environmental chemicals during pregnancy and infancy. The placenta is expected to be an effective barrier protecting the developing embryo against some endocrine disruptors (EDs) circulating in maternal blood. The current study was designed to assess in utero exposure levels of non-persistent organic pollutants (non-POPs) and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in Chinese newborns and potential role of placenta barrier against fetal exposure to these commonly-used environmental endocrine disruptors. A total of 230 newborn-mother pairs were enrolled during 2010-2011, 201 pairs of which were recruited from Shanghai, and the other 29 pairs came from Wenzhou. Maternal blood, cord blood, and meconium specimens were collected in the subject population from Shanghai and analyzed for non-POPs, including mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), octylphenol (OP) and 4-nonylphenol (4-NP). A total of 19 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) congeners, which belong to POPs, were detected in maternal and cord blood specimens from the other 29 pairs. Fetal-maternal ratios (F-M ratios) and regression coefficients were presented to assess potential function of placenta on barricading the mother/fetal transfer of these EDs. Concentrations of the detected non-POPs in cord blood samples were approximately 20\% lower than those in maternal blood, and regression coefficients of which were all over 0.80. In contrast, PBDEs levels in cord blood samples were significantly higher than those in maternal blood. MEHP levels in meconium were much higher than those in cord blood samples, and highly correlated. Therefore, observations demonstrated that the placental barrier slightly decreased the fetal exposure to most non-POPs, while PBDEs seemed to be totally transferred across the placenta and finally reached the fetus. For in utero exposure assessment of Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), MEHP level in meconium may be a useful biomarker.},

This study was designed to assess the effects of DEHP on DNA methylation of imprinting genes in germ cells from fetal and adult mouse. Pregnant mice were treated with DEHP at doses of 0 and 40~{$\mu$}g DEHP/kg body weight/day from 0.5 to 18.5~day post coitum. The data revealed DEHP exposure significantly reduced the percentage of methylated CpG sites in Igf2r and Peg3 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in primordial germ cells from female and male fetal mouse, particularly, in the oocytes of 21 dpp mice (F1), which were produced by the pregnant micetreated with DEHP. More surprisingly, the modification of the DNA methylation of imprinted genes in F1 mouse oocytes was heritable to F2 offspring which exhibit lower percentages of methylated CpG sites in imprinted genes DMRs. In conclusion, DEHP exposure can affect the DNA methylation of imprinting genes not only in fetal mouse germ cells and growing oocytes, but also in offspring's oocytes.},

  abstract = {Background: DNA methylation offers an excellent example for elucidating how epigenetic information affects gene expression. {$\beta$} values and M values are commonly used to quantify DNA methylation. Statistical methods applicable to DNA methylation data analysis span a number of approaches such as Wilcoxon rank sum test, t-test, Kolmogorov\textendash Smirnov test, permutation test, empirical Bayes method, and bump hunting method. Nonetheless, selection of an optimal statistical method can be challenging when different methods generate inconsistent results from the same data set. Results: We compared six statistical approaches relevant to DNA methylation microarray analysis in terms of false discovery rate control, statistical power, and stability through simulation studies and real data examples. Observable differences were noticed between {$\beta$} values and M values only when methylation levels were correlated across CpG loci. For small sample size (n =3 or 6 in each group), both the empirical Bayes and bump hunting methods showed appropriate FDR control and the highest power when methylation levels across CpG loci were independent. Only the bump hunting method showed appropriate FDR control and the highest power when methylation levels across CpG sites were correlated. For medium (n=12 in each group) and large sample sizes (n=24 in each group), all methods compared had similar power, except for the permutation test whenever the proportion of differentially methylated loci was low. For all sample sizes, the bump hunting method had the lowest stability in terms of standard deviation of total discoveries whenever the proportion of differentially methylated loci was large. The apparent test power comparisons based on raw p-values from DNA methylation studies on ovarian cancer and rheumatoid arthritis provided results as consistent as those obtained in the simulation studies. Overall, these results provide guidance for optimal statistical methods selection under different scenarios. Conclusions: For DNA methylation studies with small sample size, the bump hunting method and the empirical Bayes method are recommended when DNA methylation levels across CpG loci are independent, while only the bump hunting method is recommended when DNA methylation levels are correlated across CpG loci. All methods are acceptable for medium or large sample sizes.},

Both dimethyl phthalate (DMP) and DEHP were correlated with higher MT and MT-2A expression, while diethyl phthalate (DEP) was also positively correlated with MT-1A and FATP1 expression in female infants. DEHP exposure was negatively correlated with birth weight and gestational age in male infants.

Colon cancer tissues and tumor-adjacent normal tissues of 60 colon cancer patients (who received surgical operation in our hospital from January 2012 to December 2014) were collected. SW1116 cells in human colon cancer tissues were selected for culturing. 5-aza-2c-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) was utilized as an inhibitor of the methylation for APC gene. Methylation specific PCR (MSP) was utilized for detection of APC methylation in SW1116 cells. The MTT and Transwell assays were performed to detect the effect of the methylation of APC gene on the proliferation and invasive abilities of SW1116 cells. The correlation between the methylation of APC gene and pathological parameters of colon cancer patients was analyzed. MSP results revealed that 41 cases (68.33\%) showed methylation of APC gene in colon cancer tissues. No methylation of APC gene was found in tumor-adjacent normal tissues. 5-aza-dC was able to inhibit the methylation of APC gene in SW1116 cells. APC gene methylation was correlated with tumor size, differentiation degree, lymph node metastasis and Dukes staging. In conclusion, the levels of the methylation of APC in colon cancer tissues and SW1116 cells are relatively high. The methylation of APC promoted the proliferation and invasion abilities of SW1116 cells. Furthermore, methylation is correlated with a variety of clinicopathological features of colon cancer patients.},

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To reveal the impact and the underlying mechanism of BPA on the crosstalk between trophoblast and decidual stromal cells (DSCs), we determined whether BPA was able to affect trophoblast invasion in~vitro. We found that BPA significantly inhibited CXCL8 expression in DSCs, which hindered trophoblast invasion, and activated the phosphorylation of ERK in DSCs. U0126, an inhibitor of ERK activation, remarkably rescued trophoblast invasion and the inhibition of CXCL8 expression caused by BPA treatment. Moreover, the nuclear estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 and transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor GPR30 (membrane estrogen receptor) antagonist G15 significantly blocked the phosphorylation of ERK and reversed the reduction of trophoblast invasion. In brief, BPA activated ERK through nuclear and membrane estrogen receptors and inhibited CXCL8 expression in DSCs, thereby affecting their regulation of trophoblast invasion.},

Tanshinone IIA (TIIA), a diterpene quinone phytochemical, has been shown to possess powerful antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, epigenetics, and protective effects against different diseases including DN by inhibiting ROS induced by high glucose (HG). However, epigenomic and transcriptomic study of DN and the protective effect of TIIA are lacking. In this study, next-generation sequencing of RNA and DNA methylation profiles on the potential underlying mechanisms of a DN model in mouse kidney mesangial mes13 cells challenged with HG and treatment with TIIA were conducted. Bioinformatic analysis coupled with Ingenuity Pathway analysis of RNA-seq was performed, and 1780 genes from HG/LG and 1416 genes from TIIA/HG were significantly altered. Several pro-inflammatory pathways like leukotriene biosynthesis and eicosanoid signaling pathways were activated by HG stimulation, while TIIA treatment would enhance glutathione-mediated detoxification pathway to overcome the excess oxidative stress and inflammation triggered by HG. Combination analysis of RNA-seq and Methyl-seq data sets, DNA methylation, and RNA expression of a list of DN associated genes, Nmu, Fgl2, Glo, and Kcnip2, were found to be altered in HG-induced mes13 DN model, and TIIA treatment would effectively restore the alterations. Taken together, these findings provide novel insights into the understanding of how epigenetic/epigenomic modifications could affect the progression of DN and the potential preventive effect of TIIA in DN.},

In addition, whether fetal thyroid hormones (THs) mediate the reported association remains unclear. The present study aimed to examine the association between prenatal BPA exposure and risks of child behavioral problems at 2 and 4~years of age and whether the association could be explained by alteration of fetal THs as measured in cord plasma. Using the Shanghai-Minhang Birth Cohort Study (S-MBCS), BPA concentration was measured in maternal urine samples collected at 12\textendash 16~weeks of gestation. Children's neurobehavioral development was assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist/1.5\textendash 5 (CBCL), at 2 and 4~years of age. Using generalized estimating equation (GEE) models, 745 mother-pairs were included to examine associations of BPA with CBCL scores, Using multiple linear regression models, 348 mother-pairs were included to evaluate the association between maternal BPA and THs in cord plasma. A mediation analysis was conducted to explore the potential mediating role of THs. After adjusting for potential confounders, prenatal BPA level was associated with increased risks of Emotionally Reactive problem, Anxious/Depressed problem, having Somatic Complaints, exhibiting Aggressive Behavior, and Internalizing and Externalizing Problems: compared to the lowest tertile, the risks in the highest tertile and middle tertile, ranged between 1.55-fold (95\% CI: 1.09, 2.21) and 2.59-fold (95\% CI: 1.52, 4.42). The association was more pronounced among boys. None of the associations reached statistical significance among girls. An inverse association between prenatal BPA and fetal TH level was also observed. However, the observed neurotoxic effects of prenatal BPA exposure did not appear to be mediated by THs levels. The current findings suggest that prenatal exposure to BPA may disrupt fetal THs levels and may induce long-lasting behavioral alterations, especially in boys.},

Despite the advances in bladder cancer diagnosis and therapy, there has been little progress in the patients' overall survival in nearly 30 years. Therefore, investigating novel molecular therapeutic targets is required to gain insight into the tumorigenesis of bladder cancer, which ultimately may be used to develop more effective therapeutic strategies. Methods Herein, we used gene knockdown in vitro and in vivo to unveil the unknown roles of ZSCAN16 in bladder cancer. Afterward, to decipher the unknown regulatory role of ZSCAN16 in tumor progression, we verified that a bunch of genes including NF-{$\kappa$}B, AKT, mTOR, and P38 were the key downstream regulators of ZSCAN16 by western blot and rescue experiments. Results We found high expression of ZSCAN16 transcripts in bladder cancer cells and tumor samples from the TCGA database and tissue microarray bank, demonstrated in correlation with poor prognosis for bladder cancer patients. The in vitro experiments indicated that the silencing of ZSCAN16 by shRNA lentivirus promoted apoptosis and inhibited proliferation, colony formation, as well as migration and invasion in T24 cells. By investigating the signaling pathways, we proved ZSCAN16 play a novel role as oncogenic gene in bladder cancer by regulating NF-{$\kappa$}B, AKT, mTOR, P38 and other genes. Furthermore, the in vivo experiments identified that ZSCAN16 knockdown retarded the tumor growth in nude mice. Conclusions In summary, these findings revealed that ZSCAN16 is a potential novel oncogene in the development and progression of bladder cancer. This study will shed light on developing novel therapeutic targets in the future treatment of bladder cancer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Parabens, suspected as endocrine-disrupting chemicals, are nearly ubiquitous in the human body and exposure to these chemicals during pregnancy may disrupt thyroid hormones homeostasis and even affect fetal growth, although the impacts are still unclear. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to estimate associations of maternal urinary paraben concentrations with cord serum thyroid hormones and birth weight. METHODS: A subset of 437 mother-newborn pairs were included from a prospective birth cohort with five parabens quantified in maternal urine and seven thyroid function indicators measured in cord serum samples. Multivariable linear regression models and elastic net regression (ENR) models were applied to explore associations between individual and mixtures of prenatal urinary paraben concentrations and thyroid hormones and birth weight, respectively. RESULTS: Maternal urinary ethyl-paraben (EtP) concentrations were associated with increased cord serum total triiodothyronine levels (TT3) [percent change: 1.51\%; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.20\%, 2.74\%; p=0.017]. Urinary propyl-paraben (PrP) levels predicted higher thyroid peroxidase antibodies (percent change: 4.19\%, 95\%CI: 0.20\%, 8.44\%; p=0.041). Maternal urinary EtP and butyl-paraben (BuP) concentrations were significantly positively associated with birth weight [regression coefficient, ({$\beta$})=40.9g, 95\%CI: 3.99, 76.6; p=0.030; {$\beta$}=62.1g, 95\%CI: 8.70, 115; p=0.023, for EtP and BuP, respectively]. In sex-stratified analyses, positive relationship between EtP levels and birth weight was observed in boys. Urinary EtP concentrations predicted higher TT3 levels in cord serum samples, assessing parabens as a chemical mixture with ENR models. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal exposure to parabens may affect thyroid hormone indicators with increased serum TT3 levels and associate with higher birth weight, especially in boys. The underlying biological mechanisms and effects of prenatal paraben exposures on disruption of thyroid function homeostasis and potential impacts of childhood growth and development needed to be further investigated.},

This may pose a potential bias since gestational age has been shown to dramatically influence gene expression in utero-placental tissue. By pooling data from three genome-wide transcription studies of the maternal-fetal interface, we have evaluated the relative effect of gestational age and PE on gene expression. A total of 18,180 transcripts were evaluated in 49 PE cases and 105 controls, with gestational age ranging from week 14 to 42. A total of 22 transcripts were associated with PE, whereas 92 transcripts with gestational age (nominal P value {$<$}1.51*10-6, Bonferroni adjusted P value {$<$}0.05). Our results indicate that gestational age has a great influence on gene expression both in normal and PE-complicated pregnancies.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few studies have shown an association between prenatal phthalate exposure and adverse effects on neurodevelopment and behavior in young children. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the relationship between prenatal exposure to phthalate esters and behavior syndromes in children at 8 years of age. METHODS: A total of 122 mother-child pairs from the general population in central Taiwan were studied from 2000 to 2009. Mono-methyl phthalate (MMP), mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-butyl phthalate (MBP), mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP), and three di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) metabolites-mono-2-ethylhexyl, mono-2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl, and mono-2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl phthalates (MEHP, MEHHP, and MEOHP)--were measured in maternal urine collected during the third trimester of pregnancy using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Behavioral syndromes of children at 8 years of age were evaluated using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Associations between log10-transformed creatinine-corrected phthalate concentrations and standardized scores of the CBCL were estimated using linear regression models or multinomial logistic regressions with adjustments for potential confounders. RESULTS: Externalizing problem scores were significantly higher in association with a 1-unit increase in log10-transformed creatinine-corrected concentrations of maternal MBP ({$\beta$} = 4.29; 95\% CI: 0.59, 7.99), MEOHP ({$\beta$} = 3.74; 95\% CI: 1.33, 6.15), and MEHP ({$\beta$} = 4.28 ; 95\% CI: 0.03, 8.26) after adjusting for the child's sex, intelligence, and family income. Meanwhile, MBP and MEOHP were significantly associated with Delinquent Behavior and Aggressive Behavior scores. The same pattern was found for borderline and/or clinical ranges. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest positive associations between maternal DEHP and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) exposure and externalizing domain behavior problems in 8-year-old children.},

This study aimed to evaluate the association between in utero exposure to four PFASs and the development of neurobehavioral symptoms related to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in early childhood. Methods: Eligible study subjects were selected from the Taiwan Birth Panel Study and the Taiwan EarlyLife Cohort, which enrolled a total of 1526 mother-infant pairs during 2004 and 2005. We collected umbilical cord blood and analyzed perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanyl sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUA) levels. When a child was 7 years old, to evaluate ADHD related neurobehavioral symptoms, their parents completed the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham IV scale (SNAP-IV), the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) questionnaires. We used linear regression models with inverse probability weighting to explore the association between prenatal exposure to four PFASs and ADHD rating scores. Results: A total of 282 subjects have completed the PFASs analysis and questionnaire survey. After adjusted for potential confounders, we observed that PFNA is inversely associated with inattention and oppositional defiant disorder of SNAP-IV, and hyperactivity/inattention of SDQ. No association between PFOA, PFOS, or PFUA and ADHD symptoms was found. Conclusions: Prenatal exposure to PFNA was found to associate with neurobehavioral symptoms related to ADHD among Asian seven-year-old children. Further studies are needed to elucidate the causal relationship.},

Positive correlations between PFASs and neurobehavioral problems in children were reported in cross-sectional data, but findings from prospective studies are limited. OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether prenatal exposure to PFASs is associated with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or childhood autism in children. METHODS: Among 83,389 mother-child pairs enrolled in the Danish National Birth Cohort during 1996-2002, we identified 890 ADHD cases and 301 childhood autism cases from the Danish National Hospital Registry and the Danish Psychiatric Central Registry. From this cohort, we randomly selected 220 cases each of ADHD and autism, and we also randomly selected 550 controls frequency matched by child's sex. Sixteen PFASs were measured in maternal plasma collected in early or mid-pregnancy. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) using generalized linear models, taking into account sampling weights. RESULTS: Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were detected in all samples; four other PFASs were quantified in {$\geq$} 90\% of the samples. We did not find consistent evidence of associations between mother's PFAS plasma levels and ADHD [per natural log nanograms per milliliter increase: PFOS RR = 0.87 (95\% CI: 0.74, 1.02); PFOA RR = 0.98 (95\% CI: 0.82, 1.16)] or autism [per natural log nanograms per milliliter increase: PFOS RR = 0.92 (95\% CI: 0.69, 1.22); PFOA RR = 0.98 (95\% CI: 0.73, 1.31)]. We found positive as well as negative associations between higher PFAS quartiles and ADHD in models that simultaneously adjusted for all PFASs, but these estimates were imprecise. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we found no consistent evidence to suggest that prenatal PFAS exposure increases the risk of ADHD or childhood autism in children.},

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate whether prenatal exposure to PFASs is associated with IQ in children. METHODS: We studied 1,592 pregnancies enrolled in the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC) during 1996\textendash 2002. Sixteen PFASs were measured in maternal plasma collected in early gestation. Child IQ was assessed at 5 y of age using the Wechsler Primary and Preschool Scales of Intelligence\textendash Revised (WPPSI-R) administered by trained psychologists. Using multivariable linear regression models, we estimated the differences in child IQ scores according to PFAS concentration [per natural-log (ng/mL) unit increase or values categorized in quartiles]. RESULTS: Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were detected in all samples, and five additional PFASs were quantified in {$>$}80\% of the samples. Overall, we found no strong associations between a natural-log unit increase in each of the seven PFASs we evaluated and child IQ scores. A few positive and negative associations were found in the sex-stratified PFAS quartile analyses, but the patterns were inconsistent. CONCLUSION: Overall, we did not find consistent evidence to suggest prenatal exposure to PFASs to be associated with child IQ scores at 5 y of age in the DNBC. Some of the sex-specific observations warrant further investigation. Additional studies should examine offspring IQ at older ages and assess other functional cognitive and neuropsychiatric measures in addition to intelligence. Postnatal exposures to PFASs and mixture effects for PFASs and PFASs with other environmental pollutants should also be considered in future research. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2754},

Rodent studies suggest that prenatal and postnatal neurodevelopmental toxicity from BPA exposure may manifest as social deficits in offspring. We investigated the association between prenatal and postnatal exposure to BPA and social impairments in a sample of 4-year-old children. METHODS: We recruited second-trimester pregnant women between 2008 and 2011, and measured their creatinine-adjusted prenatal urine BPA levels. In 2014-2015, a subset of 4-year-old children born to these women underwent neurobehavioral assessment and physical examination. We collected urine and blood from the children and assessed social impairments, including deficits in social interaction, social communication, and other behavior patterns using the Korean version of the Social Communication Questionnaire (K-SCQ) (n~=~304). We examined social impairments associated with prenatal exposure at mid-term pregnancy and postnatal exposure to BPA at 4~years of age, using linear and piecewise linear regression models. RESULTS: The relationship between prenatal BPA exposure and social communication was non-linear and statistically significant at or above the flexion point for BPA levels of 3.0~{$\mu$}g/g creatinine in girls (58.4\%, 95\% confidence interval [CI], 6.5\% to 135.8\%). Each 2-fold increase in postnatal BPA exposure was significantly associated with an 11.8\% (95\% CI, 0.6\% to 24.3\%) increase in impairment in social communication in 4-year old girls, as indicated by the linear regression model. CONCLUSION: Prenatal and postnatal BPA exposure is associated with social impairment at 4~years of age, particularly in girls.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genomic imprinting is a process causing genes to be expressed according to parental origin. Imprinting acts to coordinate fetal and prenatal growth, as well as control postnatal adaptations. Studies on human imprinting are confounded by tissue availability, sampling variability and limitations posed by tissue-specific expression and cellular heterogeneity within tissues. The human umbilical cord is an easily available, embryonic-derived fetal tissue with the potential to overcome many of these limitations. METHODS: In a sensitive, gene-specific quantitative expression analysis, we show for the first time robust imprinted gene expression combined with methylation analysis in cords isolated from Asian Chinese full-term births. RESULTS: Linear regression analyses revealed an inverse correlation between expression of pleckstrin homology-like domain, family A, member 2 (PHLDA2) with birth weight (BW). Furthermore, we observed significant down-regulation of the paternally expressed gene 10 (PEG10) in low BW babies compared to optimum BW babies. This change in PEG10 gene expression was accompanied by concomitant methylation alterations at the PEG10 promoter. CONCLUSIONS: These data are the first to demonstrate relative expression of an imprinted gene associated with epigenetic changes in non-syndromic fetal growth restriction in babies. They show that perturbed expression in compromised fetal growth may be associated with in utero modulation of the epigenetic state at the imprinting control regions and implicate specific imprinted genes as new biomarkers of fetal growth.},

During pregnancy, the placenta undergoes many structural and functional changes in response to fetal needs and environmental exposures. Previous studies have demonstrated widespread epigenetic and gene expression changes from early to late pregnancy. However, on the global level, how DNA methylation changes impact on gene expression in human placenta is not yet well understood. We performed DNA methylome analysis by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and gene expression analysis by RNA-Seq for both first and third trimester human placenta tissues. From first to third trimester, 199 promoters (corresponding to 189 genes) and 2,297 gene bodies were differentially methylated, with a clear dominance of hypermethylation (96.8\% and 93.0\% for promoters and gene bodies, respectively). A total of 2,447 genes were differentially expressed, of which 77.2\% were down-regulated. Gene ontology analysis using differentially expressed genes were enriched for cell cycle and immune response functions. The correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression was non-linear and complex, depending on the genomic context (promoter or gene body) and gene expression levels. A wide range of DNA methylation and gene expression changes were observed at different gestational ages. The non-linear association between DNA methylation and gene expression indicates that epigenetic regulation of placenta development is more complex than previously envisioned.},

  abstract = {Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) has been utilized in many products for years. DEHP exposure has been linked to cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and its risk factors. Recent evidence has found a crucial role for epigenetics, including DNA methylation, in CVD. Moreover, DEHP exposure has proved to alter DNA methylation in epidemiological studies. However, the interplay between DEHP exposure, global DNA methylation, and atherosclerosis has never been reported. In this current study, we enrolled 793 participants (12-30 years) from a Taiwanese population to investigate the association between concentrations of DEHP metabolites, 5mdC/dG (global DNA methylation marker) and the carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT). The results showed urine mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) level was positively correlated with 5mdC/dG and CIMT, respectively. In logistic regression models, the odds ratios (OR) of thicker CIMT (greater than 75th percentile) with one unit increase in ln-MEHP level was higher when levels of 5mdC/dG were above 50\%. In structural equation model, the result showed urine MEHP levels are directly associated with CIMT. Moreover, MEHP had an indirect association with CIMT through the 5mdC/dG after adjusting other confounding effects. In the current study, urine DEHP metabolite levels were positively correlated with 5mdC/dG, and CIMT. Our results showed DEHP had a direct and indirect association with CIMT through the 5mdC/dG. The finding implies that DNA methylation may mediate the association between DEHP exposures and subclinical atherosclerosis in this young population. Future effort is needed to elucidate the causal relationship between DEHP exposure, DNA methylation and CVD.},

The objective of this study was to pursue potential risk factors and signal transcription pathways involved in PVD pathogenesis. Gene expression in subjects with PVD and with normal pregnancies was compared using a two-channel microarray technique. Higher expression of HSPA6 and HSPA1A was exhibited in PVD subjects. HSPA6 and HSPA1A both encode HSP70, and, therefore, we localized HSP70 expression in placental tissue. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot, we observed a significant upregulation of HSP70 in both mRNA and protein levels in placental tissue and microvascular endothelial cells of PVD subjects when compared with normal pregnancies (P{$<$} 0.05). HSP70 mRNA and protein expression also correlated negatively with infant birth weight (P{$<$} 0.05). HSP70 was expressed mainly in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells in the placental microvessels. We therefore conclude that HSP70 may mediate endothelial activation and play a role in pathogenesis of PVD.},

The most common EGFR mutation, EGFRvIII, sensitizes GBM cells to the BET-bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 in a SOX9, FOXG1-dependent manner.

  abstract = {Background: Illumina's HumanMethylation450 arrays provide the most cost-effective means of high-throughput DNA methylation analysis. As with other types of microarray platforms, technical artifacts are a concern, including background fluorescence, dye-bias from the use of two color channels, bias caused by type I/II probe design, and batch effects. Several approaches and pipelines have been developed, either targeting a single issue or designed to address multiple biases through a combination of methods. We evaluate the effect of combining separate approaches to improve signal processing. Results: In this study nine processing methods, including both within- and between- array methods, are applied and compared in four datasets. For technical replicates, we found both within- and between-array methods did a comparable job in reducing variance across replicates. For evaluating biological differences, within-array processing always improved differential DNA methylation signal detection over no processing, and always benefitted from performing background correction first. Combinations of within-array procedures were always among the best performing methods, with a slight advantage appearing for the between-array method Funnorm when batch effects explained more variation in the data than the methylation alterations between cases and controls. However, when this occurred, RUVm, a new batch correction method noticeably improved reproducibility of differential methylation results over any of the signal-processing methods alone. Conclusions: The comparisons in our study provide valuable insights in preprocessing HumanMethylation450 BeadChip data. We found the within-array combination of Noob + BMIQ always improved signal sensitivity, and when combined with the RUVm batch-correction method, outperformed all other approaches in performing differential DNA methylation analysis. The effect of the data processing method, in any given data set, was a function of both the signal and noise.},

We aim to examine whether pregnancy maternal acetaminophen use increases the risk for offspring asthma, and whether such a potential association could be modified by maternal coffee consumption. Methods We included 63 652 live-born singletons enrolled in the Danish National Birth Cohort. Maternal acetaminophen use and coffee consumption during pregnancy were assessed prospectively via the enrolment questionnaire and three computer-assisted telephone interviews. Asthma cases were identified by using the Danish National Patient Register and the Danish National Prescription Registry. We estimated the hazard ratios (HRs) for asthma according to prenatal acetaminophen and coffee exposure using Cox proportional hazards regression model. Results After adjusting for potential confounders, acetaminophen use during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of offspring asthma (HR = 1.16, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.11\textendash 1.22). Coffee drinking during pregnancy was associated with a slightly decreased risk (HR = 0.94, 95\%CI: 0.90\textendash 0.99). But there was no strong evidence of effect measure modification of acetaminophen use on offspring asthma by coffee consumption. Conclusions Acetaminophen use during pregnancy was associated with a modest increased risk for offspring asthma, which was not modified by coffee consumption.

We exposed 4-week-old male C57BL/6j mice to DEHP by gavage at 0, 125, 250 or 500~mg/kg body weight/day for 28 consecutive days. Our data showed that pubertal exposure to DEHP induces sperm count reduction as well as histological abnormalities in seminiferous epithelium and apoptosis of post-meiotic germ cells, and these effects are concomitant with reduction of testosterone levels and its steroidogenic gene expression. Moreover, the expressions of estrogen receptor ER{$\beta$} and nuclear receptors Nr0b1, Nr0b2 are increased. The expression of Nr5a2 which is the inducer of steroidogenesis is significantly reduced. Furthermore, spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) self-renewal, differentiation and meiosis were significantly impaired, and the epigenetic regulator G9a-mediated histone methylation was decreased following DEHP exposure. Our results suggest that the DEHP-induced male reproductive impairments may depend on its estrogenic action on estrogen receptor and nuclear receptor, and involve inhibition of steroidogenesis, SSC self-renewal and meiosis, which may be attributed to the down-regulation of G9a-mediated histone methylation.},

  abstract = {The impact of neurotoxic chemical mixtures on children's health is a critical public health concern. It is well known that during early life, toxic exposures may impact cognitive function during critical time intervals of increased vulnerability, known as windows of susceptibility. Knowledge on time windows of susceptibility can help inform treatment and prevention strategies, as chemical mixtures may affect a developmental process that is operating at a specific life phase. There are several statistical challenges in estimating the health effects of time-varying exposures to multi-pollutant mixtures, such as: multi-collinearity among the exposures both within time points and across time points, and complex exposure\textendash response relationships. To address these concerns, we develop a flexible statistical method, called lagged kernel machine regression (LKMR). LKMR identifies critical exposure windows of chemical mixtures, and accounts for complex non-linear and non-additive effects of the mixture at any given exposure window. Specifically, LKMR estimates how the effects of a mixture of exposures change with the exposure time window using a Bayesian formulation of a grouped, fused lasso penalty within a kernel machine regression (KMR) framework. A simulation study demonstrates the performance of LKMR under realistic exposure-response scenarios, and demonstrates large gains over approaches that consider each time window separately, particularly when serial correlation among the time-varying exposures is high. Furthermore, LKMR demonstrates gains over another approach that inputs all time-specific chemical concentrations together into a single KMR. We apply LKMR to estimate associations between neurodevelopment and metal mixtures in Early Life Exposures in Mexico and Neurotoxicology, a prospective cohort study of child health in Mexico City.},

However, how the human trophoblast lineage is regulated, including the categorization of the placental cell subtypes is poorly understood. Here we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on sorted placental cells from first- and second-trimester human placentas. New subtypes of cells of the known cytotrophoblast cells (CTBs), extravillous trophoblast cells (EVTs), Hofbauer cells, and mesenchymal stromal cells were identified and cell-type-specific gene signatures were defined. Functionally, this study revealed many previously unknown functions of the human placenta. Notably, 102 polypeptide hormone genes were found to be expressed by various subtypes of placental cells, which suggests a complex and significant role of these hormones in regulating fetal growth and adaptations of maternal physiology to pregnancy. These results document human placental trophoblast differentiation at single-cell resolution and thus advance our understanding of human placentation during the early stage of pregnancy.},

  abstract = {Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a type of phthalate plasticizer found in a variety of consumer products and poses a public health concern due to its metabolic and endocrine disruption activities. Dysregulation of epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, has been shown to be an important mechanism for the pathogenic effects of prenatal exposures, including phthalates. In this study, we used an established mouse model to study the effect of perinatal DEHP exposure on the DNA methylation profile in liver (a primary target tissue of DEHP) and blood (a common surrogate tissue) of both juvenile and adult mice. Despite exposure ceasing at 3\,weeks of age (PND21), we identified thousands of sex-specific differential DNA methylation events in 5-month old mice, more than identified at PND21, both in blood and liver. Only a small number of these differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) overlapped between the time points, or between tissues (i.e. liver and blood), indicating blood may not be an appropriate surrogate tissue to estimate the effects of DEHP exposure on liver DNA methylation. We detected sex-specific DMCs common between 3-week and 5-month samples, pointing to specific DNA methylation alterations that are consistent between weanling and adult mice. In summary, this is the first study to assess the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in liver and blood at two different aged cohorts in response to perinatal DEHP exposure. Our findings cast light on the implications of using surrogate tissue instead of target tissue in human population-based studies and identify epigenetic biomarkers for DEHP exposure.},

This model is an alternative to regression models, nonparametrically linking a response vector to covariate data through cluster membership (Molitor, Papathomas, Jerrett, and Richardson 2010). The package allows binary, categorical, count and continuous response, as well as continuous and discrete covariates. Additionally, predictions may be made for the response, and missing values for the covariates are handled. Several samplers and label switching moves are implemented along with diagnostic tools to assess convergence. A number of R functions for post-processing of the output are also provided. In addition to fitting mixtures, it may additionally be of interest to determine which covariates actively drive the mixture components. This is implemented in the package as variable selection.},

The IUGR group consisted of 19 fetuses from pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia and 16 from healthy mothers. Color Doppler evaluation of umbilical, spiral and uterine arteries was performed. Placental specimens from both normal and growth-retarded fetuses were obtained at the time of delivery. Placental specimens were evaluated using histochemical and immunohistochemical techniques. A progressive decrease in the pulsatility index was observed in umbilical, spiral and uterine arteries throughout pregnancy in the normal-growth fetuses. High umbilical artery pulsatility index values were obtained in 29 out of the 35 growth-retarded fetuses, six of them showing absent or reversed end-diastolic umbilical artery flow pattern. A total of 13 IUGR fetuses showed high resistance uterine artery flow velocity waveforms. Increased pulsatility index values were obtained from the spiral arteries of 16 growth-retarded fetuses. Abnormal histological and histochemical placental patterns were observed in all the growth-retarded fetuses with umbilical artery Doppler abnormalities. The presence of a peculiar dendritic cell subpopulation, strongly resembling the Langerhans cells, expressing the HLA-DR+/CD1+ phenotype, was detected in all growth-retarded fetuses, whether there was maternal pathology or not. Our data show uterine and spiral artery data as being ineffective in the monitoring of IUGR fetuses. The placental extracellular matrix seems to play an important role in the regulation of the umbilical circulation. The presence of CD1+ cells as a sign of a possible immunological mechanism in the pathogenesis of the intrauterine growth retardation is discussed.},

  abstract = {Carcinogenesis is accompanied by widespread DNA methylation changes within the cell. These changes are characterised by a globally hypomethylated genome with focal hypermethylation of numerous 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3' (CpG) islands, often spanning gene promoters and first exons. Many of these epigenetic changes occur early in tumorigenesis and are highly pervasive across a tumour type. This allows DNA methylation cancer biomarkers to be suitable for early detection and also to have utility across a range of areas relevant to cancer detection and treatment. Such tests are also simple in construction, as only one or a few loci need to be targeted for good test coverage. These properties make cancer-associated DNA methylation changes very attractive for development of cancer biomarker tests with substantive clinical utility. Across the patient journey from initial detection, to treatment and then monitoring, there are several points where DNA methylation assays can inform clinical practice. Assays on surgically removed tumour tissue are useful to determine indicators of treatment resistance, prognostication of outcome or to molecularly characterise, classify and determine the tissue of origin of a tumour. Cancer-associated DNA methylation changes can also be detected with accuracy in the cell-free DNA present in blood, stool, urine and other biosamples. Such tests hold great promise for the development of simple, economical and highly specific cancer detection tests suitable for population-wide screening, with several successfully translated examples already. The ability of circulating tumour DNA liquid biopsy assays to monitor cancer in situ also allows for the ability to monitor response to therapy, to detect minimal residual disease and as an early biomarker for cancer recurrence. This review will summarise existing DNA methylation cancer biomarkers used in clinical practice across the application domains above, discuss what makes a suitable DNA methylation cancer biomarker and identify barriers to translation. We discuss technical factors such as the analytical performance and product-market fit, factors that contribute to successful downstream investment, including geography, and how this impacts intellectual property (IP), regulatory hurdles and the future of the marketplace and healthcare system.},

There is limited to no information on the link between PA during pregnancy and the molecular mechanisms governing placental function. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms through which maternal PA may influence placental function. Methods The level of PA was measured by accelerometry and gene expression was measured in term placenta with custom polymerase chain reaction (PCR) arrays and microarray analysis followed by a pathway analyses on significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Results Microarray analysis showed 43 significantly DEGs between active and non-active participants. RT-qPCR validation of a sub-sample of DEGs revealed significant changes in the level of expression between active and non-active moms (student's t-test, p~{$<~$}0.05, n~=~11). Genes involved in transport of water (p~=~0.00236) and uptake of glycerol (p~=~0.00219) were enriched in active moms. PA was also associated with the alteration of alternative splicing patters. The most consistent splicing changes were observed for AQP9 where active moms lacked exon 2. Discussion Variations in maternal PA influences placental gene. We show significant expression changes of genes that are involved in transport and localization between active and non-active women. Most notably, the expression of the aquaporin family of genes (e.g. AQP1 and AQP9) were found to be significantly higher in the placentas of active women suggesting an adaptive response for the transport of water and glycerol in this population.},

  abstract = {Background DNA epigenetic modifications, such as methylation, are important regulators of tissue differentiation, contributing to processes of both development and cancer. Profiling the tissue-specific DNA methylome patterns will provide novel insights into normal and pathogenic mechanisms, as well as help in future epigenetic therapies. In this study, 17 somatic tissues from four autopsied humans were subjected to functional genome analysis using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, covering 486 428 CpG sites. Results Only 2\% of the CpGs analyzed are hypermethylated in all 17 tissue specimens; these permanently methylated CpG sites are located predominantly in gene-body regions. In contrast, 15\% of the CpGs are hypomethylated in all specimens and are primarily located in regions proximal to transcription start sites. A vast number of tissue-specific differentially methylated regions are identified and considered likely mediators of tissue-specific gene regulatory mechanisms since the hypomethylated regions are closely related to known functions of the corresponding tissue. Finally, a clear inverse correlation is observed between promoter methylation within CpG islands and gene expression data obtained from publicly available databases. Conclusions This genome-wide methylation profiling study identified tissue-specific differentially methylated regions in 17 human somatic tissues. Many of the genes corresponding to these differentially methylated regions contribute to tissue-specific functions. Future studies may use these data as a reference to identify markers of perturbed differentiation and disease-related pathogenic mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Background: Evidence has indicated that some non-inherited factors such as exposure to environmental pollutants are associated with neurodevelopment disorders like autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Studies report that endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), including polychlorinated biphenyls, organochlorine pesticides, perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and some metals, have adverse effects on the fetal neurodevelopment. The aim of this study was to measure the amniotic fluid (AF) levels of EDCs and metals as well as the receptor transactivities induced by AF and investigate the possible link between prenatal exposure to EDCs and heavy metals and ASD risk. Methods: In this case-control study, we included AF samples of 75 ASD cases and 135 frequency-matched controls and measured the levels of the endogenous sex hormones, PFAS, and elements including heavy metals. The combined effect of endogenous hormones and EDCs on the receptor of estrogen (ER), androgen (AR), aryl hydrocarbon (AhR), and thyroid hormone-like activity were also determined and expressed as receptor ligand equivalents. We assessed the associations of AF levels of chemicals, sex hormones, and receptor activities with ASD risk using unconditional logistical regression analyses. To control for multiple comparisons, the false discovery rate (FDR) was used and q values less than 0.25 were designated as statistical significance. Results: PFAS and metals were detectable in AF samples. The ASD cases had significantly lower AF levels of PFAS than controls, and the adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 0.410 (95\% CI 0.174, 0.967; p\,=\,0.042; FDR qvalue\,=\,0.437) for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). The principal component, including PFAS congeners, copper, iron, and estrogenic activity, was significantly inversely associated with ASD risk (adjusted OR\,=\,0.100; 95\% CI 0.016, 0.630; p\,=\,0.014; FDR qvalue\,=\,0.098).Testosterone level in AF weakly associated with ASD risk (adjusted OR\,=\,1.002; 95\% CI 1.000, 1.004; p\,=\,0.05). However, after multiple comparison correction, the association was not significant (FDR qvalue\,=\,0.437). No significant associations between AF-induced receptor transactivities and ASD risk were observed. The adjusted OR was 2.176 (95\%CI 0.115, 41.153) for the ratio of the combined androgenic activity to combined estrogenic activity. Conclusions: The presence of PFAS and heavy metals in AF indicates that they can cross the placenta. The inverse association between levels of PFAS congeners in AF and ASD risk might relate to the weak estrogenic activities and anti-androgenic activities of PFAS.The observed tendency of positive association between the ratio of combined androgenic effect to the combined estrogenic effect and ASD risk needs further studies to explore whether EDCs together with endogenous hormones play a role in the development of ASD.},

We define a methylation signature of bladder cancer and evaluate whether this profile assesses prognosis of patients. Genome-wide methylation analysis was performed on 70 tumor and 10 normal bladder samples. Hypermethylation status of 1505 CpGs present in the promoter region of 807 genes was studied. Thirty-three genes were significantly hypermethylated in {$\geq$}10\% of the tumors. Three clusters of patients were characterized by their DNA methylation profile, one at higher risk of dead of disease (p = 0.0012). Association between cluster distribution and stage (p = 0.02) or grade (p = 0.02) was demonstrated. Hypermethylation of JAK3 and absence of hypermethylation of EYA4, GAT6, and SOX1 were associated with low-grade non-invasive disease. On the other hand, in high-grade invasive disease hypermethylation of CSPG2, HOXA11, HOXA9, HS3ST2, SOX1, and TWIST1 was associated with muscle invasiveness. A panel of hypermethylated genes including APC, CSPG2, EPHA5, EYA4, HOXA9, IPF1, ISL1, JAK3, PITX2, SOX1, and TWIST1 predicted cancer-specific survival and SOX1 (HR = 3.46), PITX2 (HR = 4.17), CSPG2 (HR = 5.35), and JAK3 hypermethylation (HR = 0.19) did so independently. Silencing of genes by hypermethylation is a common event in bladder cancer and could be used to develop diagnostic and prognostic markers. Combined hypermethylation of SOX1, PITX2, or CSPG2 signals patients at higher risk of death from bladder cancer.},

  abstract = {Background: Exposure to environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may play an important role in the epidemic of metabolic diseases. Epigenetic alterations may functionally link EDCs with gene expression and metabolic traits. Objectives: We aimed to evaluate metabolic-related effects of the exposure to endocrine disruptors including five parabens, three bisphenols, and 13 metabolites of nine phthalates as measured in 24-hour urine on epigenomewide DNA methylation. Methods: A blood-based epigenome-wide association study was performed in 622 participants from the Lifelines DEEP cohort using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 methylation data and EDC excretions in 24-hour urine. Out of the 21 EDCs, 13 compounds were detected in {$>$} 75\% of the samples and, together with bisphenol F, were included in these analyses. Furthermore, we explored the putative function of identified methylation markers and their correlations with metabolic traits. Results: We found 20 differentially methylated cytosine-phosphate-guanines (CpGs) associated with 10 EDCs at suggestive p-value {$<$} 1 \texttimes{} 10-6, of which four, associated with MEHP and MEHHP, were genome-wide sig\- nificant (Bonferroni-corrected p-value {$<$} 1.19 \texttimes{} 10-7). Nine out of 20 CpGs were significantly associated with at least one of the tested metabolic traits, such as fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, blood lipids, and/or blood pressure. 18 out of 20 EDC-associated CpGs were annotated to genes functionally related to metabolic syndrome, hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance and glycemic traits. Conclusions: The identified DNA methylation markers for exposure to the most common EDCs provide suggestive mechanism underlying the contributions of EDCs to metabolic health. Follow-up studies are needed to unravel the causality of EDC-induced methylation changes in metabolic alterations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Air pollution has been related to brain structural alterations, but a relationship with white matter microstructure is unclear. OBJECTIVES: We assessed whether pregnancy and childhood exposures to air pollution are related to white matter microstructure in preadolescents. METHODS: We used data of 2,954 children from the Generation R Study, a population-based birth cohort from Rotterdam, Netherlands (2002-2006). Concentrations of 17 air pollutants including nitrogen oxides (NOX), particulate matter (PM), and components of PM were estimated at participants' homes during pregnancy and childhood using land-use regression models. Diffusion tensor images were obtained at child's 9-12 years of age, and fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were computed. We performed linear regressions adjusting for socioeconomic and lifestyle characteristics. Single-pollutant analyses were followed by multipollutant analyses using the Deletion/Substitution/Addition (DSA) algorithm. RESULTS: In the single-pollutant analyses, higher concentrations of several air pollutants during pregnancy or childhood were associated with significantly lower FA or higher MD (p{$<$}0.05). In multipollutant models of pregnancy exposures selected by DSA, higher concentration of fine particles was associated with significantly lower FA [-0.71 (95\% CI: -1.26, -0.16) per 5\,{$\mu$}g/m3 fine particles] and higher concentration of elemental silicon with significantly higher MD [0.06 (95\% CI: 0.01, 0.11) per 100\,ng/m3 silicon]. Multipollutant models of childhood exposures selected by DSA indicated significant associations of NOX with FA [-0.14 (95\% CI: -0.23, -0.04) per 20-{$\mu$}g/m3 NOX increase], and of elemental zinc and the oxidative potential of PM with MD [0.03 (95\% CI: 0.01, 0.04) per 10-ng/m3 zinc increase and 0.07 (95\% CI: 0.00, 0.44) per 1-nmol\,DTT/min/m3 oxidative potential increase]. Mutually adjusted models of significant exposures during pregnancy and childhood indicated significant associations of silicon during pregnancy, and zinc during childhood, with MD. DISCUSSION: Exposure in pregnancy and childhood to air pollutants from tailpipe and non-tailpipe emissions were associated with lower FA and higher MD in white matter of preadolescents. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4709.},

  abstract = {Background Studies investigating the relationship between exposure to air pollution and brain development using magnetic resonance images are emerging. However, most studies have focused only on prenatal exposures, and have included a limited selection of pollutants. Here, we aim to expand the current knowledge by studying pregnancy and childhood exposure to a wide selection of pollutants, and brain morphology in preadolescents. Methods We used data from 3133 preadolescents from a birth cohort from Rotterdam, the Netherlands (enrollment: 2002\textendash 2006). Concentrations of nitrogen oxides, coarse, fine, and ultrafine particles, and composition of fine particles were estimated for participant's home addresses in pregnancy and childhood, using land use regression models. Structural brain images were obtained at age 9\textendash 12 years. We assessed the relationships of air pollution exposure, with brain volumes, and surface-based morphometric data, adjusting for socioeconomic and life-style characteristics, using single as well as multi-pollutant approach. Results No associations were observed between air pollution exposures and global volumes of total brain, and cortical and subcortical grey matter. However, we found associations between higher pregnancy and childhood air pollution exposures with smaller corpus callosum, smaller hippocampus, larger amygdala, smaller nucleus accumbens, and larger cerebellum (e.g. -69.2mm3 hippocampal volume [95\%CI -129.1 to -9.3] per 1ng/m3 increase in pregnancy exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). Higher pregnancy exposure to air pollution was associated with smaller cortical thickness while higher childhood exposure was associated with predominantly larger cortical surface area. Conclusion Higher pregnancy or childhood exposure to several air pollutants was associated with altered volume of several brain structures, as well as with cortical thickness and surface area. Associations showed some similarity to delayed maturation and effects of early-life stress.},

  abstract = {Quantitative measurements of environmental factors greatly improve the quality of epidemiologic studies but can pose challenges because of the presence of upper or lower detection limits or interfering compounds, which do not allow for precise measured values. We consider the regression of an environmental measurement (dependent variable) on several covariates (independent variables). Various strategies are commonly employed to impute values for interval-measured data, including assignment of one-half the detection limit to nondetected values or of "fill-in" values randomly selected from an appropriate distribution. On the basis of a limited simulation study, we found that the former approach can be biased unless the percentage of measurements below detection limits is small (5-10\%). The fill-in approach generally produces unbiased parameter estimates but may produce biased variance estimates and thereby distort inference when 30\% or more of the data are below detection limits. Truncated data methods (e.g., Tobit regression) and multiple imputation offer two unbiased approaches for analyzing measurement data with detection limits. If interest resides solely on regression parameters, then Tobit regression can be used. If individualized values for measurements below detection limits are needed for additional analysis, such as relative risk regression or graphical display, then multiple imputation produces unbiased estimates and nominal confidence intervals unless the proportion of missing data is extreme. We illustrate various approaches using measurements of pesticide residues in carpet dust in control subjects from a case-control study of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.},

To avoid surgical ligation, these patients may benefit from an alternative therapy. The objective of this research is to report the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen for the treatment of PDA in a cohort of premature neonates. METHODS Demographics and clinical course were retrospectively evaluated for all neonates admitted during the study period who received acetaminophen for the treatment of PDA. Initial acetaminophen dosing was 15 mg/kg every 6 hours (88\% intravenous). Efficacy was analyzed from ductal constriction on echocardiogram as well as need for further PDA treatment. Markers of hepatic and renal function as well as respiratory support and neonatal morbidities were evaluated to describe the safety of acetaminophen. RESULTS Forty-one neonates were identified with a median birth weight of 760 g (IQR 614\textendash{} 948 g) and median gestational age of 25 weeks (IQR 24\textendash 27 weeks). Treatment was initiated at a median postnatal age of 15 days (IQR 8\textendash 19 days) for a median duration of 7 days (IQR 6\textendash 10 days). Twenty-seven neonates (66\%) required no further PDA treatment, with echocardiographic PDA closure documented in 10 neonates (24\%) and reduced ductal size in 15 neonates (37\%). No clinically significant adverse effects attributable to acetaminophen therapy were detected. CONCLUSIONS Most patients in this study responded to acetaminophen treatment for PDA, indicating that this therapy may be an option for extremely low-birth-weight neonates in order to avoid surgical ligation.},

  abstract = {Preeclampsia, a relatively common pregnancy disorder, is a major contributor to maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide. An elevation in microRNA-210 (miR-210) expression in the placenta has been reported to be associated with preeclampsia. Our bioinformatic analysis showed that thrombospondin type I domain containing 7A (THSD7A) is a predicted target for miR-210. The aim of this study was to determine whether miR-210 is involved in preeclampsia through its targeting of THSD7A in human placental trophoblasts. In preeclamptic placental tissues, THSD7A levels were significantly downregulated, and were inversely correlated with the levels of miR-210. THSD7A was validated as a direct target of miR-210 using quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and dual luciferase assays in HTR8/SVneo cells. Transwell insert invasion assays showed that THSD7A mediated the invasion-inhibitory effect of miR-210 in HTR8/SVneo cells. Interestingly, hypoxia markedly increased miR-210 expression while suppressing THSD7A expression in a time-dependent manner in HTR8/SVneo cells. This study provides novel data on the function of THSD7A in human placental cells, and extends our knowledge of how miR-210 is involved in the development of the preeclampsia.},

To investigate the effects of AQP1 gene knockout on expression of other aquaporin water channels (AQP3, AQP8 and AQP9) in placentas and fetal membranes. METHODS: Mice were sacrificed at 9.5, 13.5 and 16.5 gestational day (GD). Amniotic fluid volume, osmolality and composition, fetal membranes, placental and fetal weights as well as placenta areas were recorded in Aqp1 homozygote conceptus group, heterozygote conceptus group and wild-type group, respectively. The expression of AQP1, AQP3, AQP8 and AQP9 mRNA and protein in placenta and fetal membranes were examined by quantitative Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting. RESULTS: Aqp1 homozygote conceptus had a greater volume of amniotic fluid, lower osmolality and calcium concentration than their wild-type counterparts at 16.5 GD. There was no significant difference in expression of AQP1, AQP3, AQP8 and AQP9 in placentas among three groups. While expression of AQP8 was increased at 13.5 and 16.5 GD in fetal membranes, the expression of AQP9 was significantly decreased in fetal membranes in Aqp1 homozygote group compared with Aqp1 heterozygote and wild-type groups. CONCLUSION: AQP1 may play an important role in the homeostasis of maternal-fetal fluid at late gestation days. The mechanism of mutual compensation among AQPs gene needs further investigation.},

The expression and location of AQP1 and other AQPs in the placenta and foetal membranes of AQP1-/- mice, AQP1-siRNA transfected WISH cells and oligohydramnios patients were also detected. Compared to control mice, AQP1-/- mice exhibited reduced copulation plug and successful pregnancy rates, but these effects were accompanied by a larger AF volume and lower AF osmolality at late gestation. AQP9 expression was significantly decreased in the placenta and foetal membranes of AQP1-/- mice, while AQP8 level was elevated in the foetal membranes of AQP1-/- mice. Moreover, AQP9 expression was suppressed in WISH cells after AQP1 downregulation. Furthermore, AQP9 expression was associated with AQP1 level in the placenta and foetal membranes in oligohydramnios. AQP1 may play a critical role in regulating pregnancy outcome and maternal-foetal fluid homeostasis.

Effects of early-life exposure to atmospheric pollutants were reported, based on outdoor air pollution levels. For both exposure families, exposure misclassification is expected from these designs: for non-persistent chemicals, because a spot biospecimen is unlikely to capture exposure over windows longer than a few days; for air pollutants, because indoor levels are ignored. We developed a couple-child cohort relying on deep phenotyping and extended personal exposure assessment aiming to better characterize the effects of components of the exposome, including air pollutants and non-persistent endocrine disruptors, on child health and development. Pregnant women were included in SEPAGES couple-child cohort (Grenoble area) from 2014 to 2017. Maternal and children exposure to air pollutants was repeatedly assessed by personal monitors. DNA, RNA, serum, plasma, placenta, cord blood, meconium, child and mother stools, living cells, milk, hair and repeated urine samples were collected. A total of 484 pregnant women were recruited, with excellent compliance to the repeated urine sampling protocol (median, 43 urine samples per woman during pregnancy). The main health outcomes are child respiratory health using early objective measures, growth and neurodevelopment. Compared to former studies, the accuracy of assessment of non-persistent exposures is expected to be strongly improved in this new type of birth cohort tailored for the exposome concept, with deep phenotyping and extended exposure characterization. By targeting weaknesses in exposure assessment of the current approaches of cohorts on effects of early life environmental exposures with strong temporal variations, and relying on a rich biobank to provide insight on the underlying biological pathways whereby exposures affect health, this design is expected to provide deeper understanding of the interplay between the Exposome and child development and health.},

Furthermore, treatment with TCS significantly inhibited the methylated DNA-binding domain 2 (MBD2), MBD3, and MeCP2 mRNA transcription. In addition, treatment with TCS promoted the accumulation of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in a dose-dependent manner, which was abrogated by treatment with an antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Collectively, our data indicated that TCS reduced the levels of GDM and down-regulated the MBD2, MBD3, and MeCP2 gene expression by increasing 8-OHdG levels and inhibiting the DNMT1 activity in HepG2 cells.},

  abstract = {Neural networks were widely used for quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) in the 1990s. Because of various practical issues (e.g., slow on large problems, difficult to train, prone to overfitting, etc.), they were superseded by more robust methods like support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), which arose in the early 2000s. The last 10 years has witnessed a revival of neural networks in the machine learning community thanks to new methods for preventing overfitting, more efficient training algorithms, and advancements in computer hardware. In particular, deep neural nets (DNNs), i.e. neural nets with more than one hidden layer, have found great successes in many applications, such as computer vision and natural language processing. Here we show that DNNs can routinely make better prospective predictions than RF on a set of large diverse QSAR data sets that are taken from Merck's drug discovery effort. The number of adjustable parameters needed for DNNs is fairly large, but our results show that it is not necessary to optimize them for individual data sets, and a single set of recommended parameters can achieve better performance than RF for most of the data sets we studied. The usefulness of the parameters is demonstrated on additional data sets not used in the calibration. Although training DNNs is still computationally intensive, using graphical processing units (GPUs) can make this issue manageable.},

  abstract = {Epigenetics is focused on understanding the control of gene expression beyond what is encoded in the sequence of DNA. Central to growing interest in the field is the hope that more can be learned about the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms underlying processes of human development and disease. Researchers have begun to examine epigenetic alterations - such as changes in promoter DNA methylation, genomic imprinting, and expression of miRNA - to learn more about epigenetic regulation in the placenta, an organ whose proper development and function are crucial to the health, growth, and survival of the developing fetus. A number of studies are now making important links between alterations to appropriate epigenetic regulation in the placenta and diseases of gestation and early life. In addition, these studies are adding important insight into our understanding of trophoblast biology and differentiation as well as placental immunology. Examining epigenetic alterations in the placenta will prove especially important in the search for biomarkers of exposure, pathology, and disease risk and can provide critical insights into the biology of development and pathogenesis of disease. Thus, epigenetic alterations may aid in disease diagnosis and prognosis as well as in targeting new treatment and prevention strategies.},

  abstract = {Background: Prenatal mercury (Hg) exposure is associated with adverse child neurobehavioral outcomes. Because Hg can interfere with placental functioning and cross the placenta to target the fetal brain, prenatal Hg exposure can inhibit fetal growth and development directly and indirectly. Objectives: We examined potential associations between prenatal Hg exposure assessed through infant toenail Hg, placental DNA methylation changes, and newborn neurobehavioral outcomes. Methods: The methylation status of {$>$} 485,000 CpG loci was interrogated in 192 placental samples using Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadArray. Hg concentrations were analyzed in toenail clippings from a subset of 41 infants; neurobehavior was assessed using the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scales (NNNS) in an independent subset of 151 infants. Results: We identified 339 loci with an average methylation difference {$>$} 0.125 between any two toenail Hg tertiles. Variation among these loci was subsequently found to be associated with a highrisk neurodevelopmental profile (omnibus p-value = 0.007) characterized by the NNNS. Ten loci had p {$<$} 0.01 for the association between methylation and the high-risk NNNS profile. Six of 10 loci reside in the EMID2 gene and were hypomethylated in the 16 high-risk profile infants' placentas. Methylation at these loci was moderately correlated (correlation coefficients range, \textendash 0.33 to \textendash 0.45) with EMID2 expression. Conclusions: EMID2 hypomethylation may represent a novel mechanism linking in utero Hg exposure and adverse infant neurobehavioral outcomes.

  abstract = {The developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis states that adverse early life exposures can have lasting, detrimental effects on lifelong health. Exposure to maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy is associated with morbidity and mortality in offspring, including increased risks for miscarriage, stillbirth, low birth weight, preterm birth, asthma, obesity, altered neurobehavior, and other conditions. Maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy interferes with placental growth and functioning, and it has been proposed that this may occur through the disruption of normal and necessary placental epigenetic patterns. Epigenome-wide association studies have identified a number of differentially methylated placental genes that are associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy, including RUNX3, PURA, GTF2H2, GCA, GPR135, and HKR1. The placental methylation status of RUNX3 and NR3C1 has also been linked to adverse infant outcomes, including preterm birth and low birth weight, respectively. Candidate gene analyses have also found maternal smoking-associated placental methylation differences in the NR3C1, CYP1A1, HTR2A, and HSD11B2 genes, as well as in the repetitive elements LINE-1 and AluYb8. The differential methylation patterns of several genes have been confirmed to also exhibit altered gene expression patterns, including CYP1A1, CYP19A1, NR3C1, and HTR2A. Placental methylation patterns associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy may be largely gene-specific and tissue-specific and, to a lesser degree, involve global changes. It is important for future research to investigate the mechanistic roles that these differentially methylated genes may play in mediating the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and disease in later life, as well as to elucidate the potential influence of emerging tobacco product use during pregnancy, including the use of electronic cigarettes, on placental epigenetics.},

Among various epigenetic regulators of gene expression, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important players that may also be involved in the manifestation of endocrine-disrupting chemical toxicity. We sought to explore the association between maternal urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations and lncRNA expression in human placenta to better understand potential mechanisms through which lncRNAs participate in mediating phthalate toxicity. Ten patients with uncomplicated dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies at term were included in this study. Urinary (n = 10) and placenta samples (n = 20) were collected for all participants. Urinary samples were analyzed for 15 phthalate metabolites and 2 phthalate alternative metabolites. Real-time PCR arrays were used to identify and quantify 87 lncRNAs from the placental samples. We tested the Spearman correlation matrix to compare prenatal phthalate measures against placental lncRNA levels. lncRNA levels showed large variations across samples, with no significant differences in lncRNA expression within twin pairs. Mono-(carboxynonyl) phthalate demonstrated consistently strong correlations with most lncRNAs. The strongest correlation was observed between mono-hydroxyisobutyl phthalate and LOC91450 (Rspearman = 0.88, p \&lt; .001). This correlation remained significant after Bonferroni adjustment. Other strong correlations were observed between mono-isobutyl phthalate, DPP10 and HOTTIP (Rspearman = -0.91, p \&lt; .001). AIRN, DACT3.AS1, DLX6, DPP10, HOTTIP, LOC143666, and LOC91450 were strongly correlated with the greatest number of phthalate metabolites. Further studies are needed to validate these results and understand if the altered expression of lncRNAs in human placenta has clinical significance.},

The relative importance of prenatal vs infant exposure and confounding by indication remains elusive. We examined the association of prenatal and infant (first 6 months) paracetamol exposure with asthma development while addressing confounding by indication. ,  Methods: We used information from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, including 53169 children for evaluation of current asthma at 3 years, 25394 for current asthma at 7 years and 45607 for dispensed asthma medications at 7 years in the Norwegian Prescription Database. We calculated adjusted relative risks (adj. RR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) using log-binomial regression. ,  Results: There were independent modest associations between asthma at 3 years with prenatal paracetamol exposure (adj. RR 1.13; 95\% CI: 1.02\textendash 1.25) and use of paracetamol during infancy (adj. RR 1.29; 95\% CI: 1.16\textendash 1.45). The results were consistent for asthma at 7 years. The associations with prenatal paracetamol exposure were seen for different indications (pain, respiratory tract infections/influenza and fever). Maternal pain during pregnancy was the only indication that showed an association both with and without paracetamol use. Maternal paracetamol use outside pregnancy and paternal paracetamol use were not associated with asthma development. In a secondary analysis, prenatal ibuprofen exposure was positively associated with asthma at 3 years but not asthma at 7 years. ,  Conclusions: This study provides evidence that prenatal and infant paracetamol exposure have independent associations with asthma development. Our findings suggest that the associations could not be fully explained by confounding by indication.},

  abstract = {Most potent mutators heretofore detected in Escherichia coli are associated with defects in epsilon subunit of DNA polymerase III, encoded by the dnaQ gene. To elucidate the role of the alpha subunit, the catalytic subunit of the polymerase, in maintaining the high fidelity of DNA replication, we isolated a mutator mutant, the mutation (dnaE173) of which resides on the dnaE gene, encoding the alpha subunit. The dnaE173 mutant was unable to grow in salt-free L broth at temperatures exceeding 44.5 degrees C and exhibited an increased frequency of spontaneous mutations, 1,000 to 10,000-fold the wild type level, at permissive temperatures. The mutator effect of dnaE173 mutation is dominant over the wild type allele. These phenotypes are caused by a single base substitution, resulting in one amino acid change, Glu612 (GAA)----Lys(AAA), in the alpha subunit molecule. DNA polymerase III purified from the dnaE173 mutant contained both alpha and epsilon subunits, in a normal molar ratio. We found no differences between wild type and mutant polymerases in the Vmax, thermolabilities, and salt sensitivities. However, the apparent Km for the substrate nucleotide of the mutant polymerase was 1/6 of that determined with the wild type polymerase. Although the mutant polymerase retained a normal level of 3'----5' exonuclease activity, the proofreading capacity determined by "turnover assay" was significantly lower in the mutant polymerase, as compared with findings in the normal enzyme. It seems likely that the enhanced mutability in the dnaE173 strain results from, at least in part, a defect in the editing function of DNA polymerase III, and further suggests that a portion of the alpha subunit in which the amino acid change resides may be important for the proper setting of the two subunits at the replication fork so as to facilitate efficient editing during the DNA replication.},

The Illumina methylation arrays provide an economical, high-throughput and comprehensive platform for measuring methylation status in EWASs. A number of software tools have been developed for identifying disease-associated differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the epigenome. However, in practice, we found these tools typically had multiple parameter settings that needed to be specified and the performance of the software tools under different parameters was often unclear. To help users better understand and choose optimal parameter settings when using DNAm analysis tools, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of 4 popular DMR analysis tools under 60 different parameter settings. In addition to evaluating power, precision, area under precision-recall curve, Matthews correlation coefficient, F1 score and type I error rate, we also compared several additional characteristics of the analysis results, including the size of the DMRs, overlap between the methods and execution time. The results showed that none of the software tools performed best under their default parameter settings, and power varied widely when parameters were changed. Overall, the precision of these software tools were good. In contrast, all methods lacked power when effect size was consistent but small. Across all simulation scenarios, comb-p consistently had the best sensitivity as well as good control of false-positive rate.},

  abstract = {Objective: To test the hypothesis that amniotic fluid volume is increased in aquaporin 1 knockout mice. Study design: Transgenic mice deficient in aquaporin 1 protein were generated by targeted gene disruption, as described previously. After a cesarean section was performed, intact, individual gestational sacs were removed from the uterus and weighed. Amniotic fluid volume, osmolality, and fetal and placental weights were determined. Data were analyzed by a 1-way analysis of variance for ranks; Dunn's post hoc test was used to analyze significant trends. Results: Analysis of 16 litters showed 35 wild-type, 52 heterozygote, and 33 aquaporin 1 knockout mice. The knockout mice had a greater volume of amniotic fluid and lower amniotic fluid osmolality than their wild-type and heterozygote counterparts. There were no significant differences in fetal or placental weights among the groups. Conclusions: Aquaporin 1 null fetuses produce a greater volume of more dilute amniotic fluid. Our findings show that aquaporin 1 water channels in fetal membranes may contribute to amniotic fluid volume regulation. We speculate that idiopathic polyhydramnios may be associated with a deficiency of aquaporin 1 channels in human fetal membranes. Transgenic aquaporin 1 knockout mice provide a unique animal of polyhydramnios.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Polyhydramnios is a condition associated with significant perinatal morbidity. While the exact pathophysiology of this condition is unknown in the absence of obvious anatomic or organic etiologies, impaired intramembranous water transport has been shown. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that the water channel aquaporin 1 (AQP1) is expressed in human fetal membranes from term pregnancies with normal amniotic fluid (AF) volume. Therefore, we hypothesized that in pregnancies with idiopathic polyhydramnios, AQP1 expression might be reduced in fetal membranes from pregnancies with this AF volume disorder. STUDY DESIGN: Placentas were collected from women at term (37-40 weeks) who presented with either polyhydramnios (amniotic fluid index [AFI] {$>$}24.0 cm) or normal AF volume (AFI 5.0-23.9 cm). Immediately after delivery, the membranes (amnion and chorion) directly overlying the placenta and the free-floating reflected membranes were sampled (total of 4 samples from each placenta). RNA was isolated from each sample and expression was quantified using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and relative quantification of gene expression. RESULTS: Relative to pregnancies with normal AF volume, there was an increase in expression of the water channel AQP1 in all regions of the fetal membranes. The greatest increase (33-fold) was seen in the reflected amnion. CONCLUSION: AQP1 expression is increased in polyhydramnios. This finding suggests that alterations in AQP1 expression may be a compensatory response to and not a cause of idiopathic polyhydramnios. We speculate that therapies focused on regulating AQP1 expression may be useful for treating this condition.},

The two main subtypes of PHP, PHP type Ia, and Ib (PHP-Ia, PHP-Ib) are caused by molecular alterations within or upstream of the imprinted GNAS gene, which encodes Gs{$\alpha$} and other translated and untranslated products.                                         Evidence acquisition:               A PubMed search was used to identify the available studies (main query terms: pseudohypoparathyroidism; Albright hereditary osteodystrophy; GNAS; GNAS1; progressive osseous heteroplasia). The most relevant studies until February 2011 have been included in the review.                                         Evidence synthesis and conclusions:               Despite the first description of this disorder dates back to 1942, recent findings indicating complex epigenetic alterations beside classical mutations at the GNAS complex gene, pointed out the limitation of the actual classification of the disease, resulting in incorrect genetic counselling and diagnostic procedures, as well as the gap in our actual knowledge of the pathogenesis of these disorders. This review will focus on PHP type I, in particular its diagnosis, classification, treatment, and underlying molecular alterations.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Prenatal exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) might affect child health; thus estimating PFAS fetal burden is relevant. PFAS fetal burden is best estimated in cord samples; previous studies have used either maternal plasma or serum during pregnancy as proxy, but their validity is not clear. We aimed to evaluate PFAS transfer between mother and fetus and determine its predictors in a Spanish birth cohort. METHODS: We measured perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), and perfluorononanoate (PFNA) in maternal blood and cord serum from 66 mother-child pairs. We used Spearman's rank coefficients to correlate PFAS concentrations in first trimester maternal plasma and serum, with cord serum samples. We assessed PFAS placental transfer by calculating maternal to cord ratios and examined their association with maternal socio-demographic characteristics and child sex using linear regression models. RESULTS: Median concentrations of PFAS (ng/mL) of PFHxS, PFOS, PFOA, and PFNA in maternal plasma (0.79, 6.18, 2.85 and 0.84, respectively) and serum (0.84, 6.99, 2.97 and 0.85) were higher than in cord serum (0.40, 1.86, 1.90 and 0.32). PFBS was not detected. Positive Spearman's correlations (p-values{$<$}0.001) were found between maternal plasma and serum (⍴{$\geq$}0.80), maternal plasma and cord (⍴{$\geq$}0.66), and maternal serum and cord samples (⍴{$\geq$}0.67). Maternal plasma to cord ratios were above 1 (PFHxS: 2.35 [95\%CI: 2.05, 2.70], PFOS: 3.33 [3.05, 3.62], PFOA: 1.37 [1.27, 1.48], PFNA: 2.39 [2.18, 2.63]); maternal serum to cord ratios were similar. Maternal to cord ratios decreased with maternal age, but not with other socio-demographic factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that PFAS fetal body burden can be assessed using as proxy maternal plasma or serum collected early in pregnancy. Maternal age might influence PFAS placental transfer.},

In this context, application of clustering models allowing for highly dependent variables is of particular interest. We aimed to characterize patterns of domestic exposure to cleaning products using a novel clustering model allowing for highly dependent variables. Methods: To identify domestic cleaning patterns in a large population of French women, we used a mixture model of dependency blocks. This novel approach specifically models within-class dependencies, and is an alternative to the latent class model, which assumes conditional independence. Analyses were conducted in 19,398 participants of the E3N study (women aged 61e88 years) who completed a questionnaire regarding household cleaning habits. Results: Seven classes were identified, which differed with the frequency of cleaning tasks (e.g., dusting/ sweeping/hoovering) and use of specific products (e.g., bleach, sprays). The model also grouped the variables into conditionally independent blocks, providing a summary of the main dependencies among the variables. Conclusions: The mixture model of dependency blocks, a useful alternative to the latent class model, may have broader application in epidemiology, in particular, in the context of exposome research and growing need for data-reduction methods.},

  abstract = {Studies of the effects on pregnancy outcomes of in utero exposure to phthalates, contaminants that are widely present in the environment, have yielded conflicting results. In addition, the mode of assessment of exposure varies between studies. The aim of this review was therefore to establish a current state of knowledge of the phthalates and metabolites involved in unfavorable pregnancy outcomes. Extant data were analyzed to determine which biomarker is the best suited to assess the relation between in utero exposure to phthalates and pregnancy outcomes. This review of the literature was conducted using the database of PubMed. A search was made of studies investigating exposure to phthalates and the following birth outcomes: preterm birth (gestational age {$<$}37 weeks), change in gestational age, change in body size at birth (birth weight, length, head circumference), anti-androgenic function, decreased anogenital distance, cryptorchidism, hypospadias and congenital malformation. The methodological approach adopted in each study was examined, in particular the methods used for exposure assessment (biomarkers and/or questionnaire). Thirty-five studies were included. Premature birth and decreased anogenital distance were the most commonly reported outcomes resulting from a moderate level of exposure to phthalates. The principal metabolites detected and involved were primary metabolites of di-2(ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP) and di-n-butyl-phthalate (DnBP). No clear conclusion could be drawn with regard to gestational age at birth, body size at birth and congenital malformations. In epidemiological studies, maternal urine is the most suitable matrix to assess the association between in utero exposure to phthalates and pregnancy outcomes: in contrast to other matrices (cord blood, amniotic fluid, meconium and milk), sampling is easy, non-invasive and, can be repeated to assess exposure throughout pregnancy. Oxidative metabolites are the most relevant biomarkers since they are not prone to external contamination. Further epidemiological studies are required during pregnancy to i) determine the role of phthalates other than DEHP [currently replaced by various substitution products, in particular diisononyl-phthalate (DiNP)]; ii) establish the effect of phthalates on other outcomes (body size adjusted for gestational age, and congenital malformations); iii) determine the pathophysiological pathways; and iv) identify the most suitable time for biomarker determination of in utero exposure to phthalates.},

Objectives We investigated whether OP exposure, as measured by urinary dialkyl phosphate (DAP) metabolites in pregnant women and their children, was associated with attention-related outcomes among Mexican-American children living in an agricultural region of California. Methods Children were assessed at ages 3.5 years (n = 331) and 5 years (n = 323). Mothers completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). We administered the NEPSY-II visual attention subtest to children at 3.5 years and Conners' Kiddie Continuous Performance Test (K-CPT) at 5 years. The K-CPT yielded a standardized attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Confidence Index score. Psychometricians scored behavior of the 5-year-olds during testing using the Hillside Behavior Rating Scale. Results Prenatal DAPs (nanomoles per liter) were nonsignificantly associated with maternal report of attention problems and ADHD at age 3.5 years but were significantly related at age 5 years [CBCL attention problems: {$\beta$} = 0.7 points; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.2\textendash 1.2; ADHD: {$\beta$} = 1.3; 95\% CI, 0.4\textendash 2.1]. Prenatal DAPs were associated with scores on the K-CPT ADHD Confidence Index {$>$} 70th percentile [odds ratio (OR) = 5.1; 95\% CI, 1.7\textendash 15.7] and with a composite ADHD indicator of the various measures (OR = 3.5; 95\% CI, 1.1\textendash 10.7). Some outcomes exhibited evidence of effect modification by sex, with associations found only among boys. There was also limited evidence of associations between child DAPs and attention. Conclusions In utero DAPs and, to a lesser extent, postnatal DAPs were associated adversely with attention as assessed by maternal report, psychometrician observation, and direct assessment. These associations were somewhat stronger at 5 years than at 3.5 years and were stronger in boys.},

Crowding is likely to worsen with increasing population size, urbanisation, and the ongoing concerns about housing shortages. Children with behavioural difficulties are at increased risk of mental and physical health problems and poorer employment prospects. Objective To test the association between the level of crowding in the home and behavioural problems in children, and to explore what factors might explain the relationship. Methods Mothers of 2576 children from the Southampton Women's Survey population-based mother-offspring cohort were interviewed. Crowding was measured at age 2~years by people per room (PPR) and behavioural problems assessed at age 3~years with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Both were analysed as continuous measures, and multivariable linear regression models were fitted, adjusting for confounding factors: gender, age, single-parent family, maternal education, receipt of benefits, and social class. Potential mediators were assessed with formal mediation analysis. Results The characteristics of the sample were broadly representative of the population in England. Median (IQR) SDQ score was 9 (6-12) and PPR was 0.75 (0.6-1). In households that were more crowded, children tended to have more behavioural problems (by 0.20 SDQ points (95\% CI 0.08, 0.32) per additional 0.2 PPR, adjusting for confounding factors). This relationship was partially mediated by greater maternal stress, less sleep, and strained parent-child interactions. Conclusions Living in a more crowded home was associated with a greater risk of behavioural problems, independent of confounding factors. The findings suggest that improved housing might reduce childhood behavioural problems and that families living in crowded circumstances might benefit from greater support.},

In the placenta, the HSD11B2 gene encoding the 11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme, which is responsible for the inactivation of maternal cortisol, is regulated by DNA methylation, and has been shown to be susceptible to stressors from the maternal environment. Methodology/Principal Findings: We examined the association between DNA methylation of the HSD11B2 promoter region in the placenta of 185 healthy newborn infants and infant and maternal characteristics, as well as the association between this epigenetic variability and newborn neurobehavioral outcome assessed with the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scales. Controlling for confounders, HSD11B2 methylation extent is greatest in infants with the lowest birthweights (P = 0.04), and this increasing methylation was associated with reduced scores of quality of movement (P = 0.04). Conclusions/Significance: These results suggest that factors in the intrauterine environment which contribute to birth outcome may be associated with placental methylation of the HSD11B2 gene and that this epigenetic alteration is in turn associated with a prospectively predictive early neurobehavioral outcome, suggesting in some part a mechanism for the developmental origins of infant neurological health.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epigenome-wide association scans (EWAS) are an increasingly powerful and widely-used approach to assess the role of epigenetic variation in human complex traits. However, this rapidly emerging field lacks dedicated visualisation tools that can display features specific to epigenetic datasets. RESULT: We developed coMET, an R package and online tool for visualisation of EWAS results in a genomic region of interest. coMET generates a regional plot of epigenetic-phenotype association results and the estimated DNA methylation correlation between CpG sites (co-methylation), with further options to visualise genomic annotations based on ENCODE data, gene tracks, reference CpG-sites, and user-defined features. The tool can be used to display phenotype association signals and correlation patterns of microarray or sequencing-based DNA methylation data, such as Illumina Infinium 450k, WGBS, or MeDIP-seq, as well as other types of genomic data, such as gene expression profiles. The software is available as a user-friendly online tool from http://epigen.kcl.ac.uk/comet and as an R Bioconductor package. Source code, examples, and full documentation are also available from GitHub. CONCLUSION: Our new software allows visualisation of EWAS results with functional genomic annotations and with estimation of co-methylation patterns. coMET is available to a wide audience as an online tool and R package, and can be a valuable resource to interpret results in the fast growing field of epigenetics. The software is designed for epigenetic data, but can also be applied to genomic and functional genomic datasets in any species.},

  abstract = {Generalized linear models are often used to analyse discrete data. There are many proposed R2 measures for this class of models. For loglinear models for count data, Cameron and Windmeijer [An R-squared measure of goodness of fit for some common nonlinear regression models. J Econometrics. 1997;77:329\textendash 342] developed an R2-like measure based on a ratio of deviances. This quantity has since been adjusted to accommodate both overspecification and overdispersion. While these statistics are useful for Poisson and negative binomial regression models, count data often include many zeros, a phenomenon that is often handled via zero-inflated (ZI) regression models. Building on Cameron and Windmeijer's work, we propose R2 statistics for the ZI Poisson and ZI negative binomial regression contexts. We also propose adjusted R2-like versions of these quantities to avoid inflation of these statistics due to the inclusion of irrelevant covariates in the model. The properties of the proposed measures of fit are examined via simulation, and their use is illustrated on two data sets involving counts with excess zeros.},

It is used in the industry to add flexibility to polyvinyl chloride-derived plastics and its wide spread use and presence has resulted in constant human exposure through fetal development and postnatal life. Epidemiological studies have suggested an association between phthalate exposures and human reproductive effects in infant and adult populations. The effects of fetal exposure to phthalates on the male reproductive system were unequivocally shown on animal models, principally rodents, in which short term deleterious reproductive effects are well established. By contrast, information on the long term effects of DEHP in utero exposure on gonadal function are scarce, while its potential effects on other organs are just starting to emerge. The present review focuses on these novel findings, which suggest that DEHP exerts more complex and broader disruptive effects on the endocrine system and metabolism than previously thought.

  abstract = {Several studies indicate that bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates may have a role in the development of metabolic diseases using different molecular pathways, including epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. However, it is unclear whether exposure to these chemicals modifies serum levels of miRNAs associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk. In the present study, we evaluated the serum levels of miRNAs associated with GDM (miR-9-5p, miR-16-5p, miR-29a-3p and miR-330-3p) and urinary levels of phthalate metabolites (mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP), mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP), mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) and mono(2-ethyl hexyl) phthalate (MEHP)) and bisphenol A in GDM patients and women without GDM during the second trimester of gestation. We observed higher levels of miR-9-5p, miR-29a-3p and miR-330-3p in sera of patients with GDM compared to non-diabetic subjects. Phthalates were detected in 97-100\% of urine samples, while BPA only in 40\%. Urinary MEHP and BPA concentrations were remarkably higher in both study groups compared to previously reported data. Unadjusted MEHP levels and adjusted BPA levels were higher in non-diabetics than in GDM patients (p = 0.03, p = 0.02). We found positive correlations between adjusted urinary MBzP levels and miR-16-5p expression levels (p {$<$} 0.05), adjusted MEHP concentrations and miR-29a-3p expression levels (p {$<$} 0.05). We also found negative correlations between unadjusted and adjusted MBP concentrations and miR-29a-3p expression levels (p {$<$} 0.0001, p {$<$} 0.05), unadjusted MiBP concentrations and miR-29a-3p expression levels (p {$<$} 0.01). Urinary MEHP levels reflect a striking exposure to di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in pregnant Mexican women. This study highlights the need for a regulatory strategy in the manufacture of several items containing endocrine disruptors in order to avoid involuntary ingestion of these compounds in the Mexican population.},

  abstract = {Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a chemical widely distributed in the environment as is extensively used in the plastic industry. DEHP is considered an endocrine disruptor chemical (EDC) and humans are inevitably and unintentionally exposed to this EDC through several sources including food, beverages, cosmetics, medical devices, among others. DEHP exposure has been associated and may be involved in the development of various pathologies; importantly, pregnant women are a particular risk group considering that endocrine alterations during gestation may impact fetal programming leading to the development of several chronic diseases in adulthood. Recent studies have indicated that exposure to DEHP and its metabolite Mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) may impair placental development and function, which in turn would have a negative impact on fetal growth. Studies performed in several trophoblastic and placental models have shown the negative impact of DEHP and MEHP in key processes related to placental development such as implantation, differentiation, invasion and angiogenesis. In addition, many alterations in placental functions like hormone signaling, metabolism, transfer of nutrients, immunomodulation and oxidative stress response have been reported. Moreover, clinical-epidemiological evidence supports the association between DEHP exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes and pathologies. In this review, we aim to summarize for the first time current knowledge about the impact of DEHP and MEHP exposure on placental development and pathophysiology, as well as the mechanisms involved. We also remark the importance of exploring DEHP and MEHP effects in different trophoblast cell populations and discuss new perspectives regarding this topic.},

We show that a crucial early requirement for Foxg1 is in the induction of ventral cell fate in the telencephalon. To study later proliferative defects, we have adapted an iododeoxyuridine and bromodeoxyuridine double labeling protocol for use in the developing embryo, which allows estimation of cell cycle kinetics in a single specimen. This technique is used to demonstrate that the cell cycle is prematurely lengthened in the Foxg1-null telencephalon. These defects are first apparent at embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) and are most severe in the rostral telencephalon. We show that apoptosis is also reduced in the same rostral domain. These defects correspond temporally and spatially with a dramatic reduction in expression of the potent signaling molecule Fgf8. We also show that in the absence of Foxg1 an excess of neurons is produced from E11.5, depleting the progenitor pool and limiting the growth of the Foxg1(-/-) telencephalon. The increase in neurogenic division coincides with an increase in BMP signaling, as detected by immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated smad-1, -5, and -8. This study reinforces Foxg1's position as a major regulator of telencephalic neurogenesis and supports the idea that Foxg1 controls precursor proliferation via regulation of Fgf signaling and differentiation via regulation of Bmp signaling.},

Transport across the placenta could be critical for risk assessment, but the available data are sparse. The aim is to develop a method for estimating fetal exposure, via the placenta, to the most commonly-used parabens, by using a human placental perfusion model. The use of human tissue is vital for determining human fetal exposure, because animal studies are of little relevance, since the placenta exhibits significant interspecies variation. An HPLC model is currently being established to simultaneously quantify four different parabens, namely, methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben and butylparaben, and their main metabolite, p-hydroxybenzoic acid. With this model, we aim to determine the transport kinetics of these parabens across the human placenta, and to investigate placental metabolism, including differences in transport due to molecular characteristics. This will facilitate assessment of the risks associated with the use of paraben-containing products during pregnancy.},

Thus neogenin is a dependence receptor inducing cell death in the absence of RGM, whereas the presence of RGM inhibits this effect.},

  abstract = {Background Pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib (PHP-Ib) is due to epigenetic changes at the imprinted GNAS locus, including loss of methylation at the A/B differentially methylated region (DMR) and sometimes at the XL and AS DMRs and gain of methylation at the NESP DMR. Objective To investigate if quantitative measurement of the methylation at the GNAS DMRs identifies subtypes of PHP-Ib. Design and methods In 19 patients with PHP-Ib and 7 controls, methylation was characterised at the four GNAS DMRs through combined bisulfite restriction analysis and quantified through cytosine specific realtime PCR in blood lymphocyte DNA. Results A principal component analysis using the per cent of methylation at seven cytosines of the GNAS locus provided three clusters of subjects (controls n{$\frac{1}{4}$}7, autosomal dominant PHP-Ib with loss of methylation restricted to the A/B DMR n{$\frac{1}{4}$}3, and sporadic PHP-Ib with broad GNAS methylation changes n{$\frac{1}{4}$}16) that matched perfectly the combined bisulfite restriction analysis classification. Furthermore, three sub-clusters of patients with sporadic PHP-Ib, that displayed different patterns of methylation, were identified: incomplete changes at all DMRs compatible with somatic mosaicism (n{$\frac{1}{4}$}5), profound epigenetic changes at all DMRs (n{$\frac{1}{4}$}8), and unmodified methylation at XL in contrast with the other DMRs (n{$\frac{1}{4}$}3). Interestingly, parathyroid hormone concentration at the time of diagnosis correlated with the per cent of methylation at the A/B DMR. Conclusion Quantitative assessment of the methylation in blood lymphocyte DNA is of clinical relevance, allows the diagnosis of PHP-Ib, and identifies subtypes of PHPIb. These epigenetic findings suggest mosaicism at least in some patients.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The genetic material of every organism exists within the context of regulatory networks that govern gene expression-collectively called the epigenome. Animal models and human birth cohort studies have revealed key developmental periods that are important for epigenetic programming and vulnerable to environmental insults. Thus, epigenetics represent a potential mechanism through which sexually dimorphic effects of early-life exposures such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) manifest. RECENT FINDINGS: Several animal studies, and to a lesser extent human studies, have evaluated life-course sexually dimorphic health effects following developmental toxicant exposures; many fewer studies, however, have evaluated epigenetics as a mechanism mediating developmental exposures and later outcomes. To evaluate epigenetic reprogramming as a mechanistic link of sexually dimorphic early-life EDCs exposures, the following criteria should be met: (1) well-characterized exposure paradigm that includes relevant windows for developmental epigenetic reprogramming; (2) evaluation of sex-specific exposure-related epigenetic change; and (3) observation of a sexually dimorphic phenotype in either childhood, adolescence, or adulthood.},

  abstract = {Maternal prenatal exposures, including bisphenol A (BPA), are associated with offspring's risk of disease later in life. Alterations in DNA methylation may be a mechanism through which altered prenatal conditions (e.g. maternal exposure to environmental toxicants) elicit this disease risk. In the Michigan Mother and Infant Pairs Cohort, maternal first-trimester urinary BPA, bisphenol F, and bisphenol S concentrations were tested for association with DNA methylation patterns in infant umbilical cord blood leukocytes (N\,=\,69). We used the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip to quantitatively evaluate DNA methylation across the epigenome; 822~020 probes passed pre-processing and quality checks. Single-site DNA methylation and bisphenol models were adjusted for infant sex, estimated cell-type proportions (determined using cell-type estimation algorithm), and batch as covariates. Thirty-eight CpG sites [false discovery rate (FDR) {$<$}0.05] were significantly associated with maternal BPA exposure. Increasing BPA concentrations were associated with lower DNA methylation at 87\% of significant sites. BPA exposure associated DNA methylation sites were enriched for 38 pathways significant at FDR {$<$}0.05. The pathway or gene-set with the greatest odds of enrichment for differential methylation (FDR {$<$}0.05) was type I interferon receptor binding. This study provides a novel understanding of fetal response to maternal bisphenol exposure through epigenetic change.},

  abstract = {Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is the most commonly used drug in the world, with a long record of use in acute and chronic pain. In recent years, the benefits of paracetamol use in chronic conditions has been questioned, notably in the areas of osteoarthritis and lower back pain. Over the same period, concerns over the long-term adverse effects of paracetamol use have increased, initially in the field of hypertension, but more recently in other areas as well. The evidence base for the adverse effects of chronic paracetamol use consists of many cohort and observational studies, with few randomized controlled trials, many of which contradict each other, so these studies must be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, there are some areas where the evidence for harm is more robust, and if a clinician is starting paracetamol with the expectation of chronic use it might be advisable to discuss these side effects with patients beforehand. In particular, an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and a small ( 4 mmHg) increase in systolic blood pressure are adverse effects for which the evidence is particularly strong, and which show a degree of dose dependence. As our estimation of the benefits decreases, an accurate assessment of the harms is ever more important. The present review summarizes the current evidence on the harms associated with chronic paracetamol use, focusing on cardiovascular disease, asthma and renal injury, and the effects of in utero exposure.},

Here we present the result of an extensive simulation study, built on cell-separated DNA methylation profiles from Illumina Infinium 450K methylation data, to compare the performance of eight methods including the most commonly used approaches. Results We designed a rich multi-layered simulation containing a set of probes with true associations with either binary or continuous phenotypes, confounding by cell type, variability in means and standard deviations for population parameters, additional variability at the level of an individual cell-type-specific sample, and variability in the mixture proportions across samples. Performance varied quite substantially across methods and simulations. In particular, the number of false positives was sometimes unrealistically high, indicating limited ability to discriminate the true signals from those appearing significant through confounding. Methods that filtered probes had consequently poor power. QQ plots of p values across all tested probes showed that adjustments did not always improve the distribution. The same methods were used to examine associations between smoking and methylation data from a case\textendash control study of colorectal cancer, and we also explored the effect of cell-type adjustments on associations between rheumatoid arthritis cases and controls. Conclusions We recommend surrogate variable analysis for cell-type mixture adjustment since performance was stable under all our simulated scenarios.

  abstract = {Imprinted genes control fetal and placental growth in mice and in rare human syndromes, but the role of these genes in sporadic intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is less well-studied. We measured the ratio of mRNA from a maternally expressed imprinted gene, PHLDA2, to that from a paternally expressed imprinted gene, MEST, by Northern blotting in 38 IUGR-associated placentae and 75 non-IUGR placentae and found an increase in the PHLDA2/MEST mRNA ratio in IUGR (p=0.0001). Altered expression of PHLDA2 and MEST was not accompanied by changes in DNA methylation within their imprinting centers, and immunohistochemistry showed PHLDA2 protein appropriately restricted to villous and intermediate cytotrophoblast in the IUGR placentae. We next did a genome-wide survey of mRNA expression in 14 IUGR placentae with maternal vascular under-perfusion compared to 15 non-IUGR placentae using Affymetrix U133A microarrays. In this series six imprinted genes were differentially expressed by ANOVA with a Benjamini\textendash Hochberg false discovery rate of 0.05, with increased expression of PHLDA2 and decreased expression of MEST, MEG3, GATM, GNAS and PLAGL1 in IUGR placentae. At lower significance, we found IGF2 mRNA decreased and CDKN1C mRNA increased in the IUGR cases. We confirmed the significant reduction in MEG3 non-translated RNA in IUGR placentae by Northern blotting. In addition to imprinted genes, the microarray data highlighted non-imprinted genes acting in endocrine signaling (LEP, CRH, HPGD, INHBA), tissue growth (IGF1), immune modulation (INDO, PSG-family genes), oxidative metabolism (GLRX), vascular function (AGTR1, DSCR1) and metabolite transport (SLC-family solute carriers) as differentially expressed in IUGR vs. non-IUGR placentae.},

  abstract = {The group lasso is an extension of the lasso to do variable selection on (predefined) groups of variables in linear regression models. The estimates have the attractive property of being invariant under groupwise orthogonal reparameterizations. We extend the group lasso to logistic regression models and present an efficient algorithm, that is especially suitable for high dimensional problems, which can also be applied to generalized linear models to solve the corresponding convex optimization problem. The group lasso estimator for logistic regression is shown to be statistically consistent even if the number of predictors is much larger than sample size but with sparse true underlying structure. We further use a two-stage procedure which aims for sparser models than the group lasso, leading to improved prediction performance for some cases. Moreover, owing to the two-stage nature, the estimates can be constructed to be hierarchical. The methods are used on simulated and real data sets about splice site detection in DNA sequences.},

We introduce stability selection. It is based on subsampling in combination with (high-dimensional) selection algorithms. As such, the method is extremely general and has a very wide range of applicability. Stability selection provides finite sample control for some error rates of false discoveries and hence a transparent principle to choose a proper amount of regularisation for structure estimation. Variable selection and structure estimation improve markedly for a range of selection methods if stability selection is applied. We prove for randomised Lasso that stability selection will be variable selection consistent even if the necessary conditions needed for consistency of the original Lasso method are violated. We demonstrate stability selection for variable selection and Gaussian graphical modelling, using real and simulated data.},

  abstract = {Variance between studies in a meta-analysis will exist. This heterogeneity may be of clinical, methodological or statistical origin. The last of these is quantified by the I(2) -statistic. We investigated, using simulated studies, the accuracy of I(2) in the assessment of heterogeneity and the effects of heterogeneity on the predictive value of meta-analyses. The relevance of quantifying I(2) was determined according to the likely presence of heterogeneity between studies (low, high, or unknown) and the calculated I(2) (low or high). The findings were illustrated by published meta-analyses of selective digestive decontamination and weaning protocols. As expected, I(2) increases and the likelihood of drawing correct inferences from a meta-analysis decreases with increasing heterogeneity. With low levels of heterogeneity, I(2) does not appear to be predictive of the accuracy of the meta-analysis result. With high levels of heterogeneity, even meta-analyses with low I(2) -values have low predictive values. Most commonly, the level of heterogeneity in a meta-analysis will be unknown. In these scenarios, I(2) determination may help to identify estimates with low predictive values (high I(2) ). In this situation, the results of a meta-analysis will be unreliable. With low I(2) -values and unknown levels of heterogeneity, predictive values of pooled estimates may range extensively, and findings should be interpreted with caution. In conclusion, quantifying statistical heterogeneity through I(2) -statistics is only helpful when the amount of clinical heterogeneity is unknown and I(2) is high. Objective methods to quantify the levels of clinical and methodological heterogeneity are urgently needed to allow reliable determination of the accuracy of meta-analyses.},

Design, Setting, and Participants: A total of 192 consecutive unrelated CAH patients being seen as part of an observational study at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (Bethesda, MD) were prospectively studied during 2006 \textendash 2010. Patients were evaluated for clinical evidence of EDS, including cardiac evaluation. DNA was analyzed by PCR, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, Southern blot, and TNXB sequencing. Tenascin-X expression was evaluated by Western blot analysis of fibroblasts and immunostaining of the skin. CAH patients with TNXB haploinsufficiency were compared with age-matched CAH patients with normal TNXB (controls). Phenotyping of 7 parents with TNXB haploinsufficiency was performed. Main Outcome Measures: The frequency of TNXB haploinsufficiency among CAH patients and the frequency of EDS symptomatology among CAH patients with TNXB haploinsufficiency and controls. Results: TNXB haploinsufficiency, here termed CAH-X syndrome, was present in 7\% of CAH patients. Twelve of 91 patients carrying a CYP21A2 deletion (13\%) carried a contiguous deletion that extended into TNXB. One patient carried a TNXB premature stop codon. Twelve of 13 patients with CAH-X had EDS clinical features. Patients with CAH-X were more likely than age-matched controls to have joint hypermobility (P Ͻ .001), chronic joint pain (P ϭ .003), multiple joint dislocations (P ϭ .004), a structural cardiac valve abnormality by echocardiography (P ϭ .02), and reduced tenascin-X expression by Western blot and immunostaining. A subset of parents had clinical findings.

Mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, an active metabolite of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and an endocrine disruptor, has been shown to induce apoptosis in various cell types including placental cells. However, the mechanism of action of MEHP induced apoptosis is still unknown. We hypothesized that apoptosis may be mediated in part through altered microRNA(s) in placenta under MEHP exposure. In the present study, we report that MEHP increases miR-16 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner (p{$<$}0.05), while inducing apoptosis in HTR-8/SVneo. Cells treated with MEHP showed a dose-dependent increase in cytotoxicity and reactive oxygen species along with decreased cell viability. Consistent with significant increase in apoptosis analyzed by flow cytometry, we detected decreased anti-apoptotic BCL-2 at transcriptional and translational levels with MEHP (p{$<$}0.05). Knockdown of miR-16 did not decrease the BCL-2/BAX protein expression ratio in the presence of MEHP when compared to negative control demonstrating that MEHP induces apoptosis directly through miR-16. In conclusion, our study demonstrates for the first time that MEHP induces miR-16, which in turn, alters BCL-2/BAX ratio leading to increased apoptosis. This study provides a novel insight into MEHP induced epigenetic regulation in placental apoptosis which may lead to pregnancy complications.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although pregnancy concentrations of some phenols have been associated with infant size at birth, there is limited data on the effect of preconception exposure. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine paternal and maternal preconception and maternal prenatal urinary phenol concentrations in relation to birth weight and head circumference. METHODS: We evaluated 346 singletons born to 346 mothers and 184 fathers (184 couples) from a prospective preconception cohort of subfertile couples from the Environment and Reproductive Health (EARTH) Study in Boston, USA. We used multiple urine samples collected before the index pregnancy in both men and women to estimate mean preconception urinary benzophenone-3, triclosan, butylparaben, propylparaben, methylparaben, or ethylparaben concentrations. We also estimated mean maternal prenatal urinary phenol concentrations by averaging trimester-specific urine samples. Birth weight and head circumference were abstracted from delivery records. We estimated the association of natural log-phenol concentrations with birth outcomes using multivariable linear regression models, adjusting for known confounders. RESULTS: In adjusted models, each log-unit increase in paternal preconception benzophenone-3 concentration was associated with a 137 g increase in birth weight (95\% CI: 60, 214). Additional adjustment for prenatal benzophenone-3 concentration strengthened this association. None of the maternal preconception phenol concentrations were associated with birth weight. However, maternal prenatal triclosan concentrations were associated with a 38 g decrease in birth weight (95\% CI: -76, 0). Few associations were observed between phenols and head circumference except for a decrease of 0.27 cm (95\% CI: -54, 0) in relation to maternal preconception methylparaben concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Although our findings should be interpreted in light of inherent study limitations, these results suggest potential evidence of associations between some paternal or maternal phenol concentrations and birth size.},

  abstract = {Given the possible critical importance of placental gene imprinting and random monoallelic expression on fetal and infant health, most of those genes must be identified, in order to understand the risks that the baby might meet during pregnancy and after birth. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to introduce a workflow and tools for analyzing imprinted and random monoallelic gene expression in human placenta, by applying whole-transcriptome (WT) RNA sequencing of placental tissue and genotyping of coding DNA variants in family trios. Ten family trios, each with a healthy spontaneous single-term pregnancy, were recruited. Total RNA was extracted for WT analysis, providing the full sequence information for the placental transcriptome. Parental and child blood DNA genotypes were analyzed by exome SNP genotyping microarrays, mapping the inheritance and estimating the abundance of parental expressed alleles. Imprinted genes showed consistent expression from either parental allele, as demonstrated by the SNP content of sequenced transcripts, while monoallelically expressed genes had random activity of parental alleles. We revealed 4 novel possible imprinted genes (LGALS8, LGALS14, PAPPA2 and SPTLC3) and confirmed the imprinting of 4 genes (AIM1, PEG10, RHOBTB3 and ZFAT-AS1) in human placenta. The major finding was the identification of 4 genes (ABP1, BCLAF1, IFI30 and ZFAT) with random allelic bias, expressing one of the parental alleles preferentially. The main functions of the imprinted and monoallelically expressed genes included: i) mediating cellular apoptosis and tissue development; ii) regulating inflammation and immune system; iii) facilitating metabolic processes; and iv) regulating cell cycle.},

We evaluated to what extent this association is explained by confounding. Methods We investigated the association between maternal paracetamol use in the first and third trimester of pregnancy and ever wheezing or recurrent wheezing/asthma in infants in the NINFEA cohort study. Risks ratios (RR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated after adjustment for confounders, including maternal infections and antibiotic use during pregnancy. Results The prevalence of maternal paracetamol use was 30.6\% during the first and 36.7\% during the third trimester of pregnancy. The prevalence of ever wheezing and recurrent wheezing/ asthma was 16.9\% and 5.6\%, respectively. After full adjustment, the RR for ever wheezing decreased from 1.25 [1.07\textendash 1.47] to 1.10 [0.94\textendash 1.30] in the first, and from 1.26 [1.08\textendash 1.47] to 1.10 [0.93\textendash 1.29] in the third trimester. A similar pattern was observed for recurrent wheezing/asthma. Duration of maternal paracetamol use was not associated with either outcome. Further analyses on paracetamol use for three non-infectious disorders (sciatica, migraine, and headache) revealed no increased risk of wheezing in children. Conclusion The association between maternal paracetamol use during pregnancy and infant wheezing is mainly, if not completely explained by confounding.},

  abstract = {Background Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is activated by stretch (mechanical), warm temperature, some epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, and lipopolysaccharide. TRPV4 is expressed throughout the gastrointestinal epithelia and its activation induces adenosine triphosphate (ATP) exocytosis that is involved in visceral hypersensitivity. As an ATP transporter, vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT) mediates ATP storage in secretory vesicles and ATP release via exocytosis upon stimulation. Summary TRPV4 is sensitized under inflammatory conditions by a variety of factors, including proteases and serotonin, whereas methylation-dependent silencing of TRPV4 expression is associated with various pathophysiological conditions. Gastrointestinal epithelia also release ATP in response to hypo-osmolality or acid through molecular mechanisms that remain unclear. These synergistically released ATP could be involved in visceral hypersensitivity. Low concentrations of the first generation bisphosphate, clodronate, were recently reported to inhibit VNUT activity and thus clodronate may be a safe and potent therapeutic option to treat visceral pain. Key Messages This review focuses on: (1) ATP and TRPV4 activities in gastrointestinal epithelia; (2) factors that could modulate TRPV4 activity in gastrointestinal epithelia; and (3) the inhibition of VNUT as a potential novel therapeutic strategy for functional gastrointestinal disorders.},

  abstract = {Bisphenol A (BPA) is a synthetic compound used in the production of many polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. It is one of the most widely produced chemicals in the world today and is found in most canned goods, plastics, and even household dust. Exposure to BPA is almost universal: most people have measurable amounts of BPA in both urine and serum. BPA is similar in structure to estradiol and can bind to multiple targets both inside and outside the nucleus, in effect acting as an endocrine disruptor. Research on BPA exposure has accelerated in the past decade with findings suggesting that perinatal exposure to BPA can negatively impact both male and female reproduction, create alterations in behavior, and act as a carcinogen. BPA can have both short term and long term effects with the latter typically occurring through epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation. This review will draw on both human and animal studies in an attempt to synthesize the literature and examine the effects of BPA exposure on reproduction, behavior, and carcinogenesis with a focus on the potential epigenetic mechanisms by which it acts.},

The \emph{CYP21A2} gene is partially overlapped by the \emph{TNXB} gene, which encodes an extracellular matrix protein called Tenascin-X (TNX). Mutations affecting both alleles of \emph{TNXB} cause a severe, autosomal recessive form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Rarely, patients with severe, salt-wasting CAH have deletions of \emph{CYP21A2} that extend into \emph{TNXB}, resulting in a ``contiguous gene syndrome'' consisting of CAH and EDS. Heterozygosity for \emph{TNXB} mutations causing haploinsufficiency of TNX may be associated with the mild ``hypermobility form'' of EDS, which principally affects small and large joints. Studies of patients with salt-wasting CAH found that up to 10\% had clinical features of EDS, associated joint hypermobility, haploinsufficiency of TNX and heterozygosity for \emph{TNXB} mutations, now called ``CAH-X.'' These patients have joint hypermobility and a spectrum of other comorbidities associated with their connective tissue disorder, including chronic arthralgia, joint subluxations, hernias, and cardiac defects. Other disorders are beginning to be associated with TNX deficiency, including familial vesicoureteral reflux and neurologic disorders. Further work is needed to delineate the full spectrum of TNX-deficient disorders, with and without associated CAH.},

These CpGs were overrepresented in open sea and shore regions, as well as in intergenic regions. They also showed a strong enrichment of significant hits in association analyses. Furthermore, a significant proportion of common DNA methylation is at least partially genetically driven and thus may be observed similarly across tissues. These findings could be of particular relevance for studies of complex neuropsychiatric traits, which often rely on proxy tissues.},

  abstract = {Bisphenol A and phthalates are widely detected in human urine, blood, breast milk, and amniotic fluid. Both bisphenol A and phthalates have been suggested as playing a role in obesity epidemics. Exposure to these chemicals during fetal development, and its consequences should be concerning because they can cross the placenta. Thus, this study aimed to assess the association between prenatal exposure to bisphenol A and phthalates, and cord blood metabolic-related biomarkers. Maternal serum was used during the first trimester, to determine prenatal exposure to bisphenol A and phthalates. Levels of metabolic-related biomarkers in the cord blood were also determined. Linear regression models were applied to the 365 participants with both, exposure and biomarker assessments, adjusted for maternal age, pre-pregnancy body mass index, parity, education, and sex of the child. The level of bisphenol A was negatively associated with the leptin level ({$\beta$} = -0.06, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: -0.11, -0.01), but was positively associated with the high-molecular-weight adiponectin level, with marginal significance ({$\beta$} = 0.03, 95\%CI: 0.00, 0.06). The mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP), mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), and summation of MEHP and MECPP to represent DEHP exposure ({$\sum$}DEHPm) levels were inversely associated with the leptin levels ({$\beta$}=-0.14, 95\%CI: -0.27, -0.01; {$\beta$} = -0.12, 95\%CI: -0.24, 0.00 with marginal significance; {$\beta$}=0.08, 95\%CI: -0.14, -0.03; and {$\beta$} = -0.09, 95\%CI: -0.16, -0.03, respectively). The present study provided some evidence that prenatal exposure to bisphenol A and certain phthalates may modify fetal adiponectin and leptin levels.},

This study aimed to examine associations between maternal serum levels of BPA and phthalate metabolites and behavioral problems at preschool age. Methods: The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was used to assess behavioral problems at 5 years of age. BPA and phthalate metabolite levels in the first trimester maternal serum was determined by LC-MS/MS for 458 children. Variables used for adjustment were parental ages, maternal cotinine levels, family income during pregnancy, child sex, birth order, and age at SDQ completed. Results: The median concentrations of BPA, MnBP, MiBP, MEHP, and MECPP, primary and secondary metabolites of phthalates, were 0.062, 26.0, 7.0, 1.40, and 0.20 ng/ml, respectively. MECPP level was associated with increase conduct problem risk (OR = 2.78, 95\% CI 1.36\textendash 5.68) overall and the association remained after child sex stratification, and odds ratios were increased with wider confidence interval (OR = 2.85, 95\% CI 1.07\textendash 7.57 for boys, OR = 4.04, 95\% CI 1.31\textendash 12.5 for girls, respectively). BPA, {$\sum$}DBPm (MnBP + MiBP), and {$\sum$}DEHPm (MEHP+MECPP) levels were not associated with any of the child behavioral problems. Conclusions: Our analyses found no significant association between BPA or summation of phthalate metabolite levels and any of the behavioral problems at 5 years of age but suggested possible association between MECPP levels and increased risk of conduct problems.},

  abstract = {Bisphenol A and phthalates are widely detected in human urine, blood, breast milk, and amniotic fluid. Both bisphenol A and phthalates have been suggested as playing a role in obesity epidemics. Exposure to these chemicals during fetal development, and its consequences should be concerning because they can cross the placenta. Thus, this study aimed to assess the association between prenatal exposure to bisphenol A and phthalates, and cord blood metabolic-related biomarkers. Maternal serum was used during the first trimester, to determine prenatal exposure to bisphenol A and phthalates. Levels of metabolic-related biomarkers in the cord blood were also determined. Linear regression models were applied to the 365 participants with both, exposure and biomarker assessments, adjusted for maternal age, pre-pregnancy body mass index, parity, education, and sex of the child. The level of bisphenol A was negatively associated with the leptin level ({$\beta$} = -0.06, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: -0.11, -0.01), but was positively associated with the high-molecular-weight adiponectin level, with marginal significance ({$\beta$} = 0.03, 95\%CI: 0.00, 0.06). The mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP), mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), and summation of MEHP and MECPP to represent DEHP exposure ({$\sum$}DEHPm) levels were inversely associated with the leptin levels ({$\beta$}=-0.14, 95\%CI: -0.27, -0.01; {$\beta$} = -0.12, 95\%CI: -0.24, 0.00 with marginal significance; {$\beta$}=0.08, 95\%CI: -0.14, -0.03; and {$\beta$} = -0.09, 95\%CI: -0.16, -0.03, respectively). The present study provided some evidence that prenatal exposure to bisphenol A and certain phthalates may modify fetal adiponectin and leptin levels.},

  abstract = {Ortho-phthalate diesters, or phthalates, are widely used synthetic chemicals found primarily in consumer products and polyvinyl chloride plastics. Experimental evidence suggests that several phthalates possess antiandrogenic properties and may disrupt endocrine pathways resulting in abnormal reproductive outcomes. Low-level exposure to phthalates has been well documented in humans, with higher levels found in children and women of childbearing age. Recent epidemiologic studies postulate that prenatal exposure to measurable urine phthalate concentrations may be associated with altered genital and pubertal development in infants and children. This review addresses the emerging evidence that some phthalates may have an adverse impact on the developing brain. The supporting animal studies and proposed mechanisms underlying the deleterious properties of phthalates in relation to neurodevelopmental outcomes are also discussed. While the observed associations are based on limited studies with a broad range of endpoints, the implications of such outcomes are of concern from a public health standpoint and merit further investigation given the widespread nature of the exposure.},

We previously demonstrated specific perturbations of fertilization, blastocyst formation, implantation, as well as aberrant glucose metabolism and adiposity in offspring using a mouse model of paternal obesity. The current investigation analyzed gene expression and methylation of specific CpG residues in F1 placentas of pregnancies fathered by obese and normal-weight male mice, using real-time PCR and bisulfite pyrosequencing. Our aim was to determine if paternal obesity deregulated placental gene expression and DNA methylation when compared to normal-weight males. Gene methylation of sperm DNA was analyzed and compared to placentas to address epigenetic transmission. Of the 10 paternally expressed genes (Pegs), 11 genes important for development and transport of nutrients, and the long-terminal repeat Intracisternal A particle (IAP) elements, derived from a member of the class II endogenous retroviral gene family, we observed a significant effect of paternal diet-induced obesity on deregulated expression of Peg3, Peg9, Peg10, and the nutrient transporter gene Slc38a2, and aberrant DNA methylation of the Peg9 promoter in F1 placental tissue. Epigenetic changes in Peg9 were also found in sperm from obese fathers. We therefore propose that paternal obesity renders changes in gene expression and/or methylation throughout the placental genome, which could contribute to the reproductive problems related to fertility and to the metabolic, long-term health impact on offspring.},

Additionally, we describe the current efforts to characterize cumulative exposures to synthetic chemicals during pregnancy. We conclude by highlighting gaps in the literature and discussing possible applications of the findings to reduce the prevalence of cumulative exposures during pregnancy.},

  abstract = {Background Prenatal exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) influences fetal development and later in life. Objective To investigate cord blood DNA methylation changes associated with prenatal exposure to PFASs. Methods We assessed DNA methylation in cord blood samples from 190 mother-child pairs from the Sapporo cohort of the Hokkaido Study (discovery cohort) and from 37 mother-child pairs from the Taiwan Maternal and Infant Cohort Study (replication cohort) using the Illumina HumanMethylation 450 BeadChip. We examined the associations between methylation and PFAS levels in maternal serum using robust linear regression models and identified differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and regions (DMRs). Results We found four DMPs with a false discovery rate below 0.05 in the discovery cohort. Among the top 20 DMPs ranked by the lowest P-values for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure, four DMPs showed the same direction of effect and P-value {$<$} 0.05 in the replication assay: cg16242615 mapped to ZBTB7A, cg21876869 located in the intergenic region (IGR) of USP2-AS1, cg00173435 mapped to TCP11L2, and cg18901140 located in IGR of NTN1. For DMRs, we found a region associated with PFOA exposure with family-wise error rate {$<$} 0.1 located in ZFP57, showing the same direction of effect in the replication cohort. Among the top five DMRs ranked by the lowest P-values that were associated with exposure to PFOS and PFOA, in addition to ZFP57, DMRs in the CYP2E1, SMAD3, SLC17A9, GFPT2, DUSP22, and TCERG1L genes showed the same direction of effect in the replication cohort. Conclusion We suggest that prenatal exposure to PFASs may affect DNA methylation status at birth. Longitudinal studies are needed to examine whether methylation changes observed are associated with differential health outcomes.},

We observed that a large portion of BPA-associated differentially methylated CpGs with p-value\,{$<$}\,0.0001 was hypomethylated among all newborns (91\%) and female infants (98\%), as opposed to being hypermethylated (88\%) among males. We found 27 and 16 CpGs with a false discovery rate (FDR)\,{$<$}\,0.05 in the analyses for males and females, respectively. Genes annotated to FDR-corrected CpGs clustered into an interconnected genetic network among males, while they rarely exhibited any interactions in females. In contrast, none of the enrichment for gene ontology (GO) terms with FDR\,{$<$}\,0.05 was observed for genes annotated to the male-specific CpGs with p\,{$<$}\,0.0001, whereas the female-specific genes were significantly enriched for GO terms related to cell adhesion.

Prenatal exposure to BPA is known to affect birth weight, but its impact on the cardiovascular system has not been studied in detail. In this study, we investigated the effects of prenatal BPA treatment and its interaction with postnatal overfeeding on the cardiovascular system. Pregnant sheep were given daily s.c. injections of corn oil (control) or BPA (0.5 mg/kg/day in corn oil) from day 30 to 90 of gestation. A subset of female offspring of these dams were overfed (OF group) to increase bodyweight to \textasciitilde 30\% over that of normal fed (NF group) controls. Cardiovascular function was assessed using non-invasive echocardiography and cuff blood pressure monitoring at 21 months of age. Ventricular tissue was analyzed for gene expression of cardiac markers of hypertrophy and collagen at the end of the observation period. Prenatal BPA exposure had no significant effects on blood pressure (BP) or morphometric measures. However, it increased ANP gene expression in the ventricles, and reduced collagen expression in the right ventricle. Overfeeding produced a marked increase in body weight and BP. There were compensatory increases in left ventricular area and internal diameter. Prenatal BPA treatment produced a significant increase in interventricular septal thickness when animals were overfed. However, it appeared to block the increase in BP and left ventricular area caused by overfeeding. Taken together these results suggest that prenatal BPA produces intrinsic changes in the heart that are capable of modulating morphological and functional parameters when animals become obese in later life.},

For this purpose, eight human subjects smoked a common Lights (10.6 mg `tar'/cig) commercial cigarette and the exhaled particulate-phase smoke from three cigarettes was collected on Cambridge pads for each smoker. The smoke collection from the human subjects was vacuum assisted. The cigarette butts from the smokers were collected and analyzed for nicotine. The machine smoking was performed with a Borgwaldt RM20 CSR smoking machine working under conditions recommended by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The nicotine levels for the cigarette butts from the smokers were used to normalize the level of exhaled smoke condensate to that of the FTC smoking conditions. The smoke condensates from exhaled smoke as well as that from the machine smoking were analyzed by a gas chromatographic technique with mass spectral peak identification. The retention efficiency for 160 compounds was calculated from the ratio of the compound peak areas in the exhaled smoke (normalized by the corresponding butt nicotine level) vs. the areas of the corresponding peaks from the chromatogram of the smoke generated by the smoking machine. In the calculation of the results, it was assumed that the composition of mainstream smoke remains practically constant at different smoking regimes. All compounds found in the machine-generated smoke were also present in the exhaled smoke, but at different levels. About one third of the compounds were retained more than 66\% by the smoker. Another third of the compounds were retained between 33\% and 66\%, and the rest of the compounds were retained very little from the mainstream particulate-phase of the cigarette smoke. The compounds retained more than 66\% were in general compounds with lower molecular weight and with higher water solubility, which eluted first from a 5\% phenyl dimethyl-polysiloxane (DB-5MS) chromatographic column. The compounds retained less than 33\% from smoke were those with higher molecular weights and boiling points, which had longer elution times from the chromatographic column. These compounds consisted mainly of long-chain hydrocarbons (saturated or squalene type) and phytosterol-type compounds. The compounds retained between 33\% and 66\% had intermediate chromatographic retention times. No attempt was made to evaluate or identify new compounds formed in the exhaled smoke. The results were obtained from a limited number of subjects, but among these the retentions for individual compounds did not show large differences, indicating that the retention process is not very different for the subjects evaluated. An attempt was made to verify whether or not the retention of compounds by the smoker is analogous to a distribution process. Only weak correlations were obtained between the human retention and octanol/water partition coefficients or between the human retention and the chromatographic retention times of individual compounds.},

These methods include gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), GC/MS/MS, liquid chromatography with UV detection (LC/UV), LC/MS, and LC/MS/MS. The study compares the advantages and disadvantages of these methods and their applicability to measuring phthalates and terephthalates in the liquids used in electronic cigarettes (e-liquids). The analytes evaluated include eight phthalates and two terephthalates. The phthalates were diethyl, dibutyl, benzyl butyl, diphenyl, bis(2-ethylhexyl), di-n-octyl, diisononyl and diisodecyl. The terephthalates were dimethyl and bis(2-ethylhexyl). Intentionally, no cleanup or concentration step were used in the methods. The methods used two chromatographic standards, dimethyl phthalate-3,4,5,6-d4, and di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate-3,4,5,6-d4. All techniques were validated for selectivity/specificity, precision, sensitivity (evaluation of LOD and LOQ), as well as for repeatability and matrix interference. The GC methods were not adequate for the analysis of diphenyl, diisononyl, and diisodecyl phthalates which were not volatile enough to be seen in the conditions used for the GC separation. Also, alcohols should not be used as solvents for the injection of the sample in the GC system to avoid transesterification in the hot injection port. The single quadrupole MS detection in GC offers sensitivities around 1 {$\mu$}g/mL in the e-liquid and was not sensitive enough for the analysis of trace phthalates and terephthalates. Compared to all evaluated methods, the MS/MS detection in GC offered the best sensitivity (below 10 ng/mL in the e-liquid). The LC is adequate for the separation of all the evaluated analytes. However, the UV detection in LC does not offer good sensitivity compared to all the other techniques. The MS detection in LC provides poor sensitivity for terephthalates, but better than the UV for the rest of the analytes. The MS/MS detection for LC offers slightly better sensitivity than the MS detection, but both LC/MS and LC/MS/MS were only able to measure levels above about 100 ng/mL of analytes in the e-liquid. A group of 39 e-liquids were analyzed by three of the evaluated procedures. Benzyl butyl phthalate, bis(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate, and di-n-octyl phthalate were not detected in the e-liquids. Some of the other evaluated phthalates were present at trace levels in certain e-liquids while most e-liquids did not contain phthalates at detectable levels.},

The purpose of this study was to determine whether increased serum Hsp70 concentrations in women with preeclampsia are related to circulating levels of cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and angiogenic factors, the key players in the pathogenesis of the disease. METHODS: Sixty preeclamptic patients and 60 normotensive, healthy pregnant women were involved in this case-control study. Levels of Hsp70 (HSPA1A) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 in maternal sera were assessed by ELISA. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IL-18, interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon-gamma-inducible protein (IP)-10, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 were determined by multiplex suspension array. Serum total soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and biologically active placental growth factor (PlGF) levels were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. For statistical analyses, the Mann-Whitney U-test, the Fisher exact and Pearson chi-square tests, the Spearman rank order correlation, multiple linear regression and logistic regression were applied. RESULTS: Serum levels of Hsp70 were significantly higher in preeclamptic patients than in healthy pregnant women. Additionally, most of the measured inflammatory variables differed significantly between the two study groups except for serum IL-1 beta and TGF-beta1 levels and IL-18/IL-12p70 and IL-12p70/IL-12p40 ratios, indicating a bias toward a pro-inflammatory status in preeclampsia. Preeclamptic patients had significantly higher sFlt-1 levels and sFlt-1/PlGF ratio and significantly lower PlGF concentrations as compared to healthy pregnant women. In the preeclamptic group, serum Hsp70 concentrations showed significant correlations with serum levels of IL-12p40 (R=0.59, p{$<$}0.001), MCP-1 (R=0.43, p{$<$}0.001), ICAM-1 (R=0.39, p=0.0020) and VCAM-1 (R=0.46, p{$<$}0.001). Furthermore, elevated serum Hsp70 level and sFlt-1/PlGF ratio had a synergistic (joint) effect in the risk of preeclampsia, as shown by the substantially higher odds ratios of their combination than of either alone. CONCLUSIONS: Increased serum Hsp70 concentrations in women with preeclampsia were associated with pro-inflammatory changes in circulating cytokine profile, suggesting that circulating Hsp70 might contribute to the development of the excessive systemic inflammatory response characteristic of the maternal syndrome of the disease.},

  abstract = {Genomic imprinting is a developmentally important mechanism that involves both differential DNA methylation and allelic histone modifications. Through detailed comparative characterization, a large imprinted domain mapping to chromosome 7q21 in humans and proximal chromosome 6 in mice was redefined. This domain is organized around a maternally methylated CpG island comprising the promoters of the adjacent PEG10 and SGCE imprinted genes. Examination of Dnmt3l-/+ conceptuses shows that imprinted expression for all genes of the cluster depends upon the germline methylation at this putative ``imprinting control region'' (ICR). Similarly as for other ICRs, we find its DNA-methylated allele to be associated with trimethylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9me3) and trimethylation of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20me3), whereas the transcriptionally active paternal allele is enriched in H3K4me2 and H3K9 acetylation. Our study reveals a novel placenta-specific transcript, TFPI2, which is expressed from the maternal allele in both humans and mice. Deficiency for the histone methyltransferase EHMT2 (also known as G9A) or for the Polycomb group protein EED, involved in repressive H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 respectively, leads to biallelic expression of Tfpi2 in the extra-embryonic lineages, whereas the other genes in the cluster maintain correct imprinting. Apart from the putative ICR, however, no other promoter regions within the domain exhibited allele-specific repressive histone modifications. This unexpected general lack of repressive histone modifications suggests that this domain may utilize a different silencing mechanism as compared to other imprinted domains.},

  abstract = {With the launch of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development/National Institutes of Health Human Placenta Project, the anticipation is that this oftenoverlooked organ will be the subject of much intense research. Compared with somatic tissues, the cells of the placenta have a unique epigenetic profile that dictates its transcription patterns, which when disturbed may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. One major class of genes that is dependent on strict epigenetic regulation in the placenta is subject to genomic imprinting, the parent-of-origin-dependent monoallelic gene expression. This review discusses the differences in allelic expression and epigenetic profiles of imprinted genes that are identified between different species, which reflect the continuous evolutionary adaption of this form of epigenetic regulation. These observations divulge that placenta-specific imprinted gene that is reliant on repressive histone signatures in mice are unlikely to be imprinted in humans, whereas intense methylation profiling in humans has uncovered numerous maternally methylated regions that are restricted to the placenta that are not conserved in mice. Imprinting has been proposed to be a mechanism that regulates parental resource allocation and ultimately can influence fetal growth, with the placenta being the key in this process. Furthermore, I discuss the developmental dynamics of both classic and transient placenta-specific imprinting and examine the evidence for an involvement of these genes in intrauterine growth restriction and placenta-associated complications. Finally, I focus on examples of genes that are regulated aberrantly in complicated pregnancies, emphasizing their application as pregnancy-related disease biomarkers to aid the diagnosis of at-risk pregnancies early in gestation.},

  abstract = {Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) pose a public health risk through disruption of normal biological processes. Identifying toxicoepigenetic mechanisms of developmental exposure-induced effects for EDCs, such as phthalates or bisphenol A (BPA), is essential. Here, we investigate whether maternal exposure to EDCs is predictive of infant DNA methylation at candidate gene regions. In the Michigan Mother-Infant Pairs (MMIP) cohort, DNA was extracted from cord blood leukocytes for methylation analysis by pyrosequencing (n = 116) and methylation changes related to first trimester levels of 9 phthalate metabolites and BPA. Growth and metabolism-related genes selected for methylation analysis included imprinted (IGF2, H19) and non-imprinted (PPARA, ESR1) genes along with LINE-1 repetitive elements. Findings revealed decreases in methylation of LINE-1, IGF2, and PPARA with increasing phthalate concentrations. For example, a log unit increase in {$\Sigma$}DEHP corresponded to a 1.03 [95\% confidence interval (CI): -1.83, -0.22] percentage point decrease in PPARA methylation. Changes in DNA methylation were also inversely correlated with PPARA gene expression determined by RT-qPCR (r = -0.34, P = 0.02), thereby providing evidence in support of functional relevance. A sex-stratified analysis of EDCs and DNA methylation showed that some relationships were female-specific. For example, urinary BPA exposure was associated with a 1.35 (95\%CI: -2.69, -0.01) percentage point decrease in IGF2 methylation and a 1.22 (95\%CI: -2.27, -0.16) percentage point decrease in PPARA methylation in females only. These findings add to a body of evidence suggesting epigenetically labile regions may provide a conduit linking early exposures with disease risk later in life and that toxicoepigenetic susceptibility may be sex specific.},

  abstract = {DNA methylation (5-methylcytosine, 5 mC) is involved in many cellular processes and is an epigenetic mechanism primarily associated with transcriptional repression. The recent discovery that 5 mC can be oxidized to 5-hydromethylcytosine (5hmC) by TET proteins has revealed the ``sixth base'' of DNA and provides additional complexity to what was originally thought to be a stable repressive mark. However, our knowledge of the genome-wide distribution of 5hmC in different tissues is currently limited. Here, we sought to define loci enriched for 5hmC in the placenta genome by combining oxidative bisulphite (oxBS) treatment with high-density Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 methylation arrays and to compare our results with those obtained in brain. Despite identifying over 17,000 high-confidence CpG sites with consistent 5hmC enrichment, the distribution of this modification in placenta is relatively sparse when compared to cerebellum and frontal cortex. Supported by validation using allelic T4 {$\beta$}-glucosyltransferase assays we identify 5hmC at numerous imprinted loci, often overlapping regions associated with parent-of-origin allelic 5 mC in both placenta and brain samples. Furthermore, we observe tissue-specific monoallelic enrichment of 5hmC overlapping large clusters of imprinted snoRNAs-miRNAs processed from long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) within the DLK1-DIO3 cluster on chromosome 14 and SNRPN-UBE3A domain on chromosome 15. Enrichment is observed solely on the transcribed alleles suggesting 5hmC is positively associated with transcription at these loci. Our study provides an extensive description of the 5hmC/5 mC landscape in placenta with our data available at www.humanimprints.net, which represents the most comprehensive resource for exploring the epigenetic profiles associated with human imprinted genes.},

In this study, we validated previous observations on abnormal levels of circulating messenger RNA (mRNA) for the tenascin-X gene in pregnancies with ventricular septal defects in the second trimester of pregnancy. METHODS: This was a bicentric retrospective study conducted from March 2016 to July 2017. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to identify abnormally expressed genes, comparing ten women carrying a euploid fetus with ventricular septal defects to 30 controls at 19-24~weeks of gestation. The univariable analysis was used to determine whether the mean mRNA for the tenascin-X gene values would differ from the expected values for the controls. RESULTS: mRNA for tenascin-X gene values was higher in ventricular septal defects, 4.38~{$\pm~$}3.01 versus 1.00~{$\pm~$}0.80. The result was still significant even after adjustment for gestational age. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm previous studies on the specific association of mRNA species and type of congenital heart defect and confirm that ventricular septal defects are associated with abnormal mRNA for the tenascin-X gene. The positive predictive value of this molecular marker in the general population should be assessed through prospective studies.},

  abstract = {The activation of the APC/beta-catenin signalling pathway due to beta-catenin mutations has been implicated in the development of a subset of endometrial carcinomas (ECs). However, up to 25\% of ECs have beta-catenin nuclear accumulation without evidence of beta-catenin mutations, suggesting alterations of other molecules that can modulate the Wnt pathway, such as APC, gamma-catenin, AXIN1 and AXIN2. We investigated the expression pattern of beta- and gamma-catenin in a group of 128 endometrial carcinomas, including 95 endometrioid endometrial carcinomas (EECs) and 33 non-endometrioid endometrial carcinomas (NEECs). In addition, we evaluated the presence of loss of heterozygosity and promoter hypermethylation of the APC gene and mutations in the APC, beta- and gamma-catenin, AXIN1, AXIN2, and RAS genes, and phospho-Akt expression. No APC mutations were detected but LOH at the APC locus was found in 24.3\% of informative cases. APC promoter 1A hypermethylation was observed in 46.6\% of ECs, and was associated with the endometrioid phenotype (P=0.034) and microsatellite instability (P=0.008). Neither LOH nor promoter hypermethylation of APC was associated with nuclear catenin expression. Nuclear beta-catenin expression was found in 31.2\% of EECs and 3\% of NEECs (P=0.002), and was significantly associated with beta-catenin gene exon 3 mutations (P{$<$}0.0001). beta-catenin gene exon 3 mutations were associated with the endometrioid phenotype, and were detected in 14 (14.9\%) EECs, but in none of the NEECs (P=0.02). gamma-catenin nuclear expression was found in 10 ECs; it was not associated with the histological type but was associated with more advanced stages (P=0.042). No mutations in gamma-catenin, AXIN1 and 2 genes were detected in this series. Neither RAS mutations nor phospho-Akt expression, which were found in 16 and 27.6\% of the cases, respectively, were associated with beta-catenin nuclear expression. Our results demonstrated a high prevalence of alterations in molecules of the APC/beta-catenin pathway, but only mutations in beta-catenin gene are associated with aberrant nuclear localization of beta-catenin.},

  abstract = {Appropriate self-renewal and differentiation of trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) are key factors for proper placental development and function and, in turn, for appropriate in utero fetal growth. To identify novel TSC-specific genes, we performed genome-wide expression profiling of TSCs, embryonic stem cells, epiblast stem cells, and mouse embryo fibroblasts, derived from mice of the same genetic background. Our analysis revealed a high expression of Sox21 in TSCs compared with other cell types. Sox21 levels were high in undifferentiated TSCs and were dramatically reduced upon differentiation. In addition, modulation of Sox21 expression in TSCs affected lineage-specific differentiation, based on both marker analysis and functional assessment. Our results implicate Sox21 specifically in the promotion of spongiotrophoblast and giant cell differentiation and establish a new mechanism through which trophoblast sublineages are specified.},

To facilitate the evaluation of the biological and evolutionary significance of imprinting, we have collated a census of known imprinted genes, listing 83 transcriptional units of which 29 are imprinted in both humans and mice. There is a high level of discordance of imprinting status between the mouse and human, even when cases in which the orthologue is absent from one species are excluded. A high proportion of imprinted genes are noncoding RNAs or genes derived by retrotransposition. Accumulation of functional and comparative data for these genes will improve our understanding of imprinting and its contribution to mammalian evolution.},

Umbilical cord blood and placental tissue collected both before and after perfusion were also analyzed. Placentas were obtained immediately after elective cesarean section and dually perfused in a recirculation system. mMP or mEHP was added to maternal perfusion medium to obtain concentrations at 10 and 25 microg/L, respectively. The placental transfer was followed analyzing samples from fetal and maternal perfusion media by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). Four perfusions with mMP indicated a slow transplacental transfer, with a feto-maternal ratio (FM ratio) of 0.30 +/- 0.03 after 150 min of perfusion. Four perfusions with mEHP indicated a very slow or nonexisting placental transfer. mEHP was only detected in fetal perfusion media from two perfusions, giving rise to FM ratios of 0.088 and 0.20 after 150 min of perfusion. Detectable levels of mMP, mEHP, monoethylphthalate (mEP), and monobutylphthalate were found in tissue. Higher tissue levels of mMP after perfusions with mMP compared to perfusions with mEHP suggest an accumulation of mMP during perfusion. No tendency for accumulation of mEHP was observed during perfusions with mEHP compared to perfusions with mMP. Detectable levels of mEHP and mEP were found in umbilical cord plasma samples. mMP and possibly other short-chained phthalate monoesters in maternal blood can cross the placenta by slow transfer, whereas the results indicate no placental transfer of mEHP.

GAS5 and GR{$\alpha$} were the predominant transcripts in both term and preterm placentas, with GAS5 being primarily localized in the syncytiotrophoblasts. In an attempt to mimic moderate and high stress environment in vitro, BeWo and JEG-3 cytotrophoblast cell lines were treated with 10\,nM\textendash 1000\,nM cortisol. Only expression of GAS5 was significantly upregulated by cortisol in all treatments compared with basal levels, but none of the GRs changed expression significantly. In an attempt to assess a stress versus gene interaction, we studied four GR polymorphisms. In the homozygous group for Tth111I polymorphism, mothers with negative attitudes towards the pregnancy gave birth to infants with significantly lower birth weights compared to women with positive/neutral attitudes. None of the GR splice variants were associated with maternal stress. However, placental GAS5 levels were inversely correlated with maternal stress. This study points towards a potential gene-environment interaction that could be of predictive value for fetal weight.},

  abstract = {Persistent organic pollutants comprised of organic chemicals like polychlorinated biphenyls, dibenzo-pdioxins, dibenzofurans and organochlorinated pesticides which have many characteristics in common. Once released in the environment they resist physical, biological, chemical and photochemical breakdown processes and thus persist in the environment. They are subject to long transboundary air pollution transport. They accumulate in the food chain due to their lipophilicity, bioaccumulation and biomagnification properties. Human exposure occurs through inhalation of air, ingestion of food and skin contact. Because most of them bioaccumulate and remain preferentially in fat, their long-term effects are still a matter of public health concern. They are condemned for health adverse effects such as cancer, reproductive defects, neurobehavioral abnormalities, endocrine and immunological toxicity. These effects can be elicited via a number of mechanisms among others include disruption of endocrine system, oxidation stress and epigenetic. However most of the mechanisms are not clear thus a number of studies are ongoing trying to elucidate them. In this review, the underlying possible mechanisms of action and their possible roles in adverse developmental and reproductive processes are discussed and where possible a linkage is made to some existing epidemiological data. Both genomic and nongenomic pathways are used to describe these effects. Understanding of these mechanisms will enable development of strategies to protect the public by reducing these adverse effects. This review is limited to persistent organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs) such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolites, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (NL-HCH) and endosulfan.},

  abstract = {Endocrine disrupting chemicals are long suspected to impair reproductive health. Bisphenol A (BPA) has estrogenic activity and therefore the capacity of interfering with endocrine pathways. No studies dissected its short-term effects on pregnancy and possible underlying mechanisms. Here, we studied how BPA exposure around implantation affects pregnancy, particularly concentrating on placentation and uterine remodeling. We exposed pregnant female mice to 50\,\textmu g/kg BPA/day or 0.1\% ethanol by oral gavage from day 1 to 7 of gestation. High frequency ultrasound was employed to document the presence and size of implantations, placentas and fetuses throughout pregnancy. Blood velocity in the arteria uterina was analyzed by Doppler measurements. The progeny of mothers exposed to BPA was growth-restricted compared to the controls; this was evident in vivo as early as at day 12 as analyzed by ultrasound and confirmed by diminished fetal and placenta weights observed after sacrificing the animals at day 14 of gestation. The remodeling of uterine spiral arteries (SAs) was considerably impaired. We show that short-term exposure to a so-called "safe" BPA dose around implantation has severe consequences. The intrauterine growth restriction observed in more than half of the fetuses from BPA-treated mothers may owe to the direct negative effect of BPA on the remodeling of uterine SAs that limits the blood supply to the fetus. Our work reveals unsuspected short-term effects of BPA on pregnancy and urges to more studies dissecting the mechanisms behind the negative actions of BPA during early pregnancy.},

Although research on this issue has not been abundant, an association with altered neurobehavior was reported by eight out of the twelve available articles, including aggressive behavior, attention deficit, hyperactivity disorder, depression and anxiety impairments, mostly in children exposed in utero, indicating disruption of the brain during this critical window of development. Despite the reduced number of studies and their heterogeneity, the results suggest that prenatal BPA exposure may have a negative impact on neurobehavioral functioning in children and that the effects may be sex-dependent. It is therefore necessary to be vigilant towards the potential adverse effects of ubiquitous low-level BPA exposure, although more studies in humans are required to convincingly confirm or rule out the association between BPA exposure and health. Meanwhile, it is desirable to inform women planning or undergoing pregnancy about measures to reduce or avoid exposure to BPA. We discuss some key aspects of the relationship between exposure and neurobehavioral outcomes.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Phthalates are known reproductive toxicants that reduce placental and fetal weight in experimental animal studies. Although phthalate exposure has been associated with reduced birth weight in humans, there is limited epidemiologic evidence on whether the placenta is also affected. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether maternal and paternal preconception and prenatal urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations are associated with placental weight, and the birth weight: placental weight (BW:PW) ratio among singletons conceived by subfertile couples. METHODS: The present analysis included 132 mothers and 68 fathers, and their corresponding 132 singletons recruited in an academic hospital fertility center in Boston, Massachusetts. Urinary concentrations of eleven phthalate metabolites were measured and averaged in multiple paternal (n = 196) and maternal (n = 596) preconception, and maternal prenatal (n = 328) samples. Placental weight and birth weight (grams) were abstracted from delivery records, and the BW:PW was calculated. We estimated the association of natural log-phthalate metabolite concentrations across windows of exposure with placental weight and the BW:PW ratio using multivariable linear regression models, adjusting for a priori covariates. RESULTS: In adjusted models, each log-unit increase in paternal urinary concentrations of the sum of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ({$\Sigma$}DEHP) metabolites was associated with a 24 g (95\% CI: -48, -1) decrease in placental weight. We also observed a significant negative association between maternal preconception monoethyl phthalate (MEP) metabolite concentrations and the BW:PW ratio ({$\beta$} = -0.26; 95\%CI: -0.49, -0.04). Additionally, each log-unit increase in prenatal MEP metabolite concentrations was associated with a 24 g (95\% CI: -41, -7) decrease in placental weight. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that certain paternal and maternal urinary phthalate metabolites may affect placental weight and the BW:PW ratio. However, given the small sample size within a subfertile cohort and the novelty of these findings, more studies are needed to confirm the present results.},

  abstract = {Concerns about the effects of bisphenol A (BPA) on human brain and behavior are not novel; however, Grohs and colleagues have contributed groundbreaking data on this topic in a recent issue of Environmental Health. For the first time, associations were reported between prenatal BPA exposure and differences in children's brain microstructure, which appeared to mediate the association between this exposure and children's behavioral symptoms. Findings in numerous previous mother-child cohorts have pointed in a similar worrying direction, linking higher BPA exposure during pregnancy to more behavioral problems throughout childhood as assessed by neuropsychological questionnaires. Notwithstanding, this body of work has not been adequately considered in risk assessment. From a toxicological perspective, results are now available from the CLARITY-BPA consortium, designed to reconcile academic and regulatory toxicology findings. In fact, the brain has consistently emerged as one of the most sensitive organs disrupted by BPA, even at doses below those considered safe by regulatory agencies such as the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). In this Commentary, we contextualize the results of Grohs et al. within the setting of previous epidemiologic and CLARITY-BPA data and express our disquiet about the ``all-or-nothing'' criterion adopted to select human data in a recent EFSA report on the appraisal methodology for their upcoming BPA risk assessment. We discuss the most relevant human studies, identify emerging patterns, and highlight the need for adequate assessment and interpretation of the increasing epidemiologic literature in this field in order to support decision-making. With the aim of avoiding a myopic or biased selection of a few studies in traditional risk assessment procedures, we propose a future reevaluation of BPA focused on neurotoxicity and based on a systematic and comprehensive integration of available mechanistic, animal, and human data. Taken together, the experimental and epidemiologic evidence converge in the same direction: BPA is a probable developmental neurotoxicant at low doses. Accordingly, the precautionary principle should be followed, progressively implementing stringent preventive policies worldwide, including the banning of BPA in food contact materials and thermal receipts, with a focus on the utilization of safer substitutes.},

All the phthalates caused negligible and non-dose-dependent ROS production compared to control experiment. DEHP and BBP did not cause significant necrotic nor apoptotic cell death at any of the studied doses. Both DIBP and DBP caused dose-dependent necrotic cell death at the two highest concentrations (100{$\mu$}M and 1mM). Both doses (500{$\mu$}M and 1mM) of DIBP increased apoptosis by 31- and 60-fold, respectively, whereas the increase in apoptotic cell death caused by DBP was only two and fourfold, that however, was not statistically significant. In conclusion, DIBP caused a substantially different apoptotic cell death effect on murine macrophages from the three other phthalates, and this effect was not related to ROS production. Thus, toxicological and health risks of DIBP and DBP should be assessed separately in the future.},

While several texts on measurement error correction methods are available, these methods remain seldomly applied. To improve the use of measurement error correction methodology, we developed mecor, an R package that implements measurement error correction methods for regression models with continuous outcomes. Measurement error correction requires information about the measurement error model and its parameters. This information can be obtained from four types of studies, used to estimate the parameters of the measurement error model: an internal validation study, a replicates study, a calibration study and an external validation study. In the package mecor, regression calibration methods and a maximum likelihood method are implemented to correct for measurement error in a continuous covariate in regression analyses. Additionally, methods of moments methods are implemented to correct for meaesurement error in the continuous outcome in regression analyses. Variance estimation of the corrected estimators is provided in closed form and using the bootstrap.},

In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that in utero exposure to the endocrine active compound, bisphenol A (BPA), influences expression and epigenetic regulation of phase I and II XME genes during development. Using healthy 1st to 2nd trimester human fetal liver specimens quantified for internal BPA levels, we examined XME gene expression using PCR Array (n =8) and RNA-sequencing (n =12) platforms. Of the greater than 160 XME genes assayed, 2 phase I and 12 phase II genes exhibited significantly reduced expression with higher BPA levels, including isoforms from the carboxylesterase, catechol O-methyltransferase, glutathione S-transferase, sulfotransferase, and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase families. When the promoters of these candidate genes were evaluated in silico, putative binding sites for the Etwenty-six (ETS) and activator protein1 (AP1) related transcription factor families were identified and unique to 97\% of all candidate transcripts. Interestingly, many ETS binding sites contain cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs) within their consensus sequences. Thus, quantitative analysis of CpG methylation of three candidate genes was conducted across n =50 samples. Higher BPA levels were associated with increased site-specific methylation at COMT (P {$<$}0.005) and increased average methylation at SULT2A1 (P {$<$}0.020) promoters. While toxicological studies have traditionally focused on high-dose effects and hormonal receptor mediated regulation, our findings suggest the importance of low-dose effects and nonclassical mechanisms of endocrine disruption during development.},

This is especially important for the endocrine active compound, bisphenol A (BPA), where studies investigating internal doses at sensitive periods of human development are currently lacking. Herein, BPA concentrations, BPA-specific metabolizing enzyme gene expression, and global DNA methylation were characterized across three matched tissues from elective pregnancy terminations of 2nd trimester human fetuses: the placenta, liver, and kidney (N=12 each; N=36 total). Compared to liver (free: 0.54-50.5 ng/g), BPA concentrations were lower in matched placenta ({$<$}0.05-25.4 ng/g) and kidney (0.08-11.1 ng/g) specimens. BPA-specific metabolism gene expression of GUSB, UGT2B15, STS, and SULT1A1 differed across each tissue type; however, conjugation and deconjugation expression patterns were similar across the fetus. Average LINE1 and CCGG global methylation were 58.3 and 59.2\% in placenta, 79.5 and 66.4\% in fetal liver, and 77.9 and 77.0\% in fetal kidney, with significant tissuespecific DNA methylation differences in both LINE1 (p-value {$<$}0.001) and CCGG content (pvalue {$<$}0.001). Total BPA concentrations were positively associated with global methylation for the placenta only using the LINE1 assay (p-value: 0.002), suggesting organ-specific biological effects after fetal exposure. Utilizing sensitive human clinical specimens, results are informative for BPA toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics assessment in the developing human fetus.},

Mother-infant interactions in cynomolgus monkeys had behavioral sexual dimorphism associated with sex of infant from early suckling period. Prenatal exposure to BPA altered the behaviors of male infants significantly; BPA-exposed male infants behaved as female infants. And it also affected some of female infant behaviors. Consequently, gestational BPA exposure altered some behaviors of their mothers, mainly in male-nursing mothers. These results suggest that BPA exposure affects behavioral sexual differentiation in male monkeys, which promotes the understanding of risk of BPA exposure in human.},

HMB has been detected in over 95\% of randomly collected human urine samples from adults and from premature infants, and it may have estrogenic potential. METHODS To determine the effects of maternal and lactational exposure to HMB on development and reproductive organs of offspring, time-mated female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed with 0, 1000, 3000, 10,000, 25,000, or 50,000 ppm HMB (seven to eight per group) added to chow from gestation day 6 until weaning on postnatal day (PND) 23. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION Exposure to HMB was associated with reduced body and organ weights in female and male offspring. No significant differences were observed in the number of implantation sites/litter, mean resorptions/litter, \% litters with resorptions, number and weights of live fetuses, or sex ratios between the control and HMB dose groups. Normalized anogenital distance in male pups at PND 23 was decreased in the highest dose group. Spermatocyte development was impaired in testes of male offspring in the highest dose group. In females, follicular development was delayed in the highest dose group. However, by evaluating levels of the compound in rat serum, the doses at which adverse events occurred are much higher than usual human exposure levels. Thus, exposure to less than 10,000 ppm HMB does not appear to be associated with adverse effects on the reproductive system in rats},

  title = {Prenatal Exposure to Phenols and Phthalates, Child Neurodevelopment and the Role of the Thyroid Hormones},
  author = {NAKIWALA, Dorothy},
  abstract = {Context: The increase in the prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders, at least in some areas, warrants identification of the possible underlying modifiable risk factors. Industrial chemicals such as phenols and phthalates, which are endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDs), are frequently detected in biospecimens from pregnant women. Several of them have been linked to various adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, at least from toxicological studies. One of the suggested mechanisms of neurotoxicity of these compounds is disruption of the thyroid hormone pathway, which plays a major role in brain development in early life. Previous research on prenatal exposure to phenolic and phthalate compounds falls short of providing: 1) an understanding of the impact of specific sources of exposure to these compounds, such as personal care products, which is necessary for interventions to reduce exposure; 2) evidence of how early life exposure to ED active phenols other than bisphenol A, such as benzophenone-3, triclosan, dichlorophenols, parabens, could influence child neurodevelopment and 3) documenting possible effects of phthalates and phenols on the thyroid hormone levels, a mechanism hypothesized to mediate neurotoxicity of these compounds. Aims: The main aims of this thesis were 1) to document if the use of personal care products (PCP) could influence phenols biomarkers concentrations in pregnant women; 2) to assess associations between prenatal exposure to phenols and phthalates and child neurodevelopment at 3 and 5 years (cognition and behavior); and 3) to assess associations between prenatal exposure to phenols and phthalates on the thyroid hormone levels of pregnant women and their newborns. Methods: We relied on three complementary cohorts. To characterize phenol levels following use of PCPs, our analysis depended on a panel study design of 8 women of the SEPAGES-feasibility study with multiple urine samples (total, 178) and detailed, time-resolved information on PCP use. Associations between phenols, phthalates and neurodevelopment (the cognitive function and behavior) were studied among 546 mother-son pairs of the French prospective EDEN cohort. We then relied on the SEPAGES cohort to study the effects of gestational exposure to phenols and phthalates on thyroid hormone levels among 418 and 421 women and newborns, respectively. In this study, intensive exposure assessment (2 pools of 21 spot urine samples per individual) allowed to limit exposure measurement error. Results: PCP as sources of exposure to phenols: The total number of PCP applications (without distinction) was positively associated with the parabens' and bisphenol S urinary concentrations during pregnancy. These associations varied by time window. The total number of PCP applications was not associated with any of the other phenols assessed. Phenols, phthalates and neurodevelopment: No phenol or phthalate metabolite pregnancy concentration was negatively associated with child verbal or performance IQ at 5 years. Some associations with child behavior were observed at 3 and 5 years: Bisphenol A was positively associated with the relationship problems subscale at 3 years, with an incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 1.11; (95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.03, 1.20) for each unit increase in Ln bisphenol A concentration, and the hyperactivity\textendash inattention subscale scores at 5 years (IRR: 1.08; 95\% CI: 1.01, 1.14). Mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) was positively associated with internalizing behavior, relationship problems, and emotional symptom scores at 3 years. Monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) was positively associated with internalizing behavior and relationship problems scores at 3 years. After dichotomizing behavioral scores, triclosan tended to be positively associated with emotional symptom subscales at both 3 and 5 years. Phenols, phthalates and thyroid hormones levels: Regarding the associations with maternal hormones, bisphenol A was negatively associated with the Ln (TSH) z-score ({$\beta$} = -0.05, 95\% CI = -0.15, 0.06); MBzP, a metabolite of benzylbutyl phthalate (BBP), was positively associated with the TT4 z-score ({$\beta$} = 0.12, 95\% CI = -0.01, 0.25) and triclosan was negatively associated with the TT3/TT4 ratio z-score ({$\beta$} = - 0.05, 95\% CI = -0.11, 0.00). When biomarker concentrations were categorized in tertiles, we observed non-monotonic associations between TSH and triclosan (U-shape) and MnBP, a metabolite of di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) (inverse U-shape). In newborns, only sex-specific effects were observed: bisphenol A was positively associated with the TT4 z-score in male newborns while triclosan was negatively associated with the TT4 z-score in females. Conclusion: Findings in this study concur with previous literature that PCPs use may contribute to exposure to parabens. Our study was the first to report associations between PCP use and bisphenol S, a substitute of bisphenol A. In line with previous studies, bisphenol A and various phthalates, including DBP and BBP exposure during pregnancy, were associated adverse behavioral symptoms among boys. Our study was the first to report adverse neurobehavioral effects in relation to triclosan exposure. These results have since been replicated in one study from the USA, while another from Canada reported null effects. The four compounds associated with adverse behavioral effects in EDEN were also associated with one or more thyroid hormone levels of mothers or newborns in the SEPAGES cohort, suggesting possible disruption of thyroid hormones homeostasis.},

  abstract = {Background: There are concerns that developmental exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals such as phenolic compounds and phthalates could affect child cognitive function. Epidemiological studies tackling this question have mainly focused on phthalate metabolites and bisphenol A, but not on the other phenolic compounds. Our study aimed to assess the relationship between in-utero exposure to phthalates, bisphenol A and other phenolic compounds (parabens, triclosan, dichlorophenols and benzophenone-3) and the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of boys at 5\textendash 6 years. Methods: In 452 mother-son dyads from the French EDEN cohort, we measured 11 phthalate metabolites and 9 phenolic compounds (4 parabens, benzophenone-3, bisphenol A, 2 dichlorophenols and triclosan) in spot urine samples collected between 22 and 29 gestational weeks. Verbal and performance IQ of children were assessed at 5\textendash 6 years by a psychologist using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI). We used adjusted Structural Equation Models (SEM) combined with Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate correction to assess the associations between maternal urine phenol and phthalate metabolite concentrations considered simultaneously and the boys' IQ. Results: No phenol or phthalate metabolite concentration was negatively associated with the boys' verbal or performance IQ (uncorrected p-values {$\geq$}0.09). Mono(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate tended to be associated with increased verbal IQ ({$\beta$} = 0.136, 95\% confidence interval, 0.01; 0.27). This association disappeared after correction for multiple comparison (corrected p-value, 0.71). Conclusion: Our results did not provide evidence of an inverse association between in-utero exposure to phenols or phthalates and verbal and performance IQ among boys. Since phenols and phthalates may have sex-specific effects, these null findings cannot be generalized to girls. Limitations included use of a single spot urine sample to assess exposures and lack of consideration of postnatal exposures.},

The relationship between DNA methylation, cytogenetic background, drug resistance and relapse in ALL is poorly understood. Results We surveyed the DNA methylation levels of 435,941 CpG sites in samples from 764 children at diagnosis of ALL and from 27 children at relapse. This survey uncovered four characteristic methylation signatures. First, compared with control blood cells, the methylomes of ALL cells shared 9,406 predominantly hypermethylated CpG sites, independent of cytogenetic background. Second, each cytogenetic subtype of ALL displayed a unique set of hyper- and hypomethylated CpG sites. The CpG sites that constituted these two signatures differed in their functional genomic enrichment to regions with marks of active or repressed chromatin. Third, we identified subtype-specific differential methylation in promoter and enhancer regions that were strongly correlated with gene expression. Fourth, a set of 6,612 CpG sites was predominantly hypermethylated in ALL cells at relapse, compared with matched samples at diagnosis. Analysis of relapse-free survival identified CpG sites with subtype-specific differential methylation that divided the patients into different risk groups, depending on their methylation status. Conclusions Our results suggest an important biological role for DNA methylation in the differences between ALL subtypes and in their clinical outcome after treatment.},

This is accompanied by a general move away from a proliferative, immature phenotype. Genome-scale expression studies have provided valuable insight into genes that are associated with the shift to both an invasive EVCT and ST phenotype, whereas genome-scale DNA methylation analysis has shown that differentiation to ST involves widespread methylation shifts, which are counteracted by low oxygen. In the current study, we sought to identify DNA methylation variation that is associated with transition from CTB to ST in vitro and from a noninvasive to invasive EVCT phenotype after culture on Matrigel. Of the several hundred differentially methylated regions that were identified in each comparison, the majority showed a loss of methylation with differentiation. This included a large differentially methylated region (DMR) in the gene body of death domain-associated protein 6 (DAXX), which lost methylation during both CTB syncytialization to ST and EVCT differentiation to invasive EVCT. Comparison to publicly available methylation array data identified the same DMR as among the most consistently differentially methylated genes in placental samples from preeclampsia pregnancies. Of interest, in vitro culture of CTB or ST in low oxygen increases methylation in the same region, which correlates with delayed differentiation. Analysis of combined epigenomics signatures confirmed DAXX DMR as a likely regulatory element, and direct gene expression analysis identified a positive association between methylation at this site and DAXX expression levels. The widespread dynamic nature of DAXX methylation in association with trophoblast differentiation and placenta-associated pathologies is consistent with an important role for this gene in proper placental development and function.\textemdash Novakovic, B., Evain-Brion, D., Murthi, P., Fournier, T., Saffery, R.

In view of the current literature, which classifies parabens as a group of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), it seems that the precise assessment of their influence on the human endocrine system is particularly important. Disruption of the endocrine homoeostasis might lead to multidirectional implications causing disruption of fitness and functions of the body.

  abstract = {Background: Organophosphate pesticides are widely used in agriculture and for other purposes, leading to ubiquitous exposure in human populations. Some studies reported cognitive deficits in children exposed pre\- natally to organophosphate pesticides, but findings from recent studies were inconsistent. Furthermore, recent biomonitoring studies suggest exposure levels have decreased. Hence, the risks from current prenatal exposure to organophosphate pesticides for child neurodevelopment are uncertain. Furthermore, sex-differences also remain to be better documented in relation to potential neurodevelopmental effects. Objective: To examine the association between prenatal exposure to organophosphate pesticides and IQ scores among boys and girls living in several major Canadian cities. Methods: We used data from the MIREC cohort (Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals). Women were recruited in 2008\textendash 2011 from 10 Canadian cities during their first trimester of pregnancy, and urine spot samples were collected for measurement of three dimethyl alkyl phosphate (DMAP) and three diethyl alkyl phosphate (DEAP) metabolites. When children were 3\textendash 4 years of age, we used the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence-III (WPPSI-III) to assess cognitive ability of children from 6 out of the 10 cities (Halifax, Hamilton, Kingston, Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver). We analysed the association between maternal exposure to organophosphate pesticides (DMAP and DEAP urinary metabolites) and children's IQ scores with generalized estimating equations (GEEs) to take into account the clustered-data resulting from the six study sites. All analyses were sex-stratified (n = 296 boys and 311 girls). Results: The participants were predominantly well-educated, white women, with a relatively high household income. Children had a mean age of 3.4 years at the moment of IQ assessment (range, 3.0\textendash 4.1 years). In girls, there was no association between IQ scores and DEAPs or DMAPs. Higher concentrations of DEAPs were significantly associated with poorer Verbal IQ scores (for a 10-fold increase in concentrations, - 6.28; 95\% CIs, - 12.13, - 0.43) in boys. The association for Performance IQ in boys also indicated poorer scores with higher DEAP concentrations, but the confidence intervals included the null value (- 4.05; 95\% CIs, - 10.19, 2.10). The relation between DMAPs and IQ scores in boys was also negative, but association estimates were small and not significant. Conclusion: Urinary metabolites of organophosphate pesticides were not associated with IQ in girls, but we observed that higher maternal urinary DEAPs were associated with poorer Verbal IQ in boys. However, exposure misclassification may be an issue as only one urine sample per woman was analysed. The present study con\- tributes to the accumulating evidence linking exposure to organophosphate pesticides during fetal development},

However, variations in urinary creatinine (a measure of dilution) or serum lipid levels, if not adequately corrected for, can directly impact biomarker concentrations and bias exposure-disease association measures. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent methodological literature has considered the complex relationships between creatinine or serum lipid levels, exposure biomarkers, outcomes, and other potentially relevant factors using directed acyclic graphs and simulation studies. The optimal measures of urinary dilution and serum lipids have also been investigated. Existing evidence supports the use of covariate-adjusted standardization plus creatinine adjustment for urinary biomarkers and standardization plus serum lipid adjustment for lipophilic, serum-based biomarkers. It is unclear which urinary dilution measure is best, but all serum lipid measures performed similarly. Future research should assess methods for pooled biomarkers and for studying diseases and exposures that affect creatinine or serum lipids directly.},

  abstract = {Small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants are fetuses that have not reached their genetically programmed growth potential. Low birth weight predisposes these infants to an increased risk of developing cardiovascular, metabolic and neurodevelopmental conditions in later life. However, our understanding of how this pathology occurs is currently incomplete. Previous research has focused on understanding the transcriptome, epigenome and bacterial signatures separately. However, we hypothesise that interactions between moderators of gene expression are critical to understanding fetal growth restriction. Through a review of the current literature, we identify that there is evidence of modulated expression/methylation of the placental genome and the presence of bacterial DNA in the placental tissue of SGA infants. We also identify that despite limited evidence of the interactions between the above results, there are promising suggestions of a relationship between bacterial signatures and placental function. This review aims to summarise the current literature concerning fetal growth from multiple avenues and propose a novel relationship between the placental transcriptome, methylome and bacterial signature that, if characterised, may be able to improve our current understanding of the placental response to stress and the aetiology of growth restriction.},

  abstract = {Background The association between exposure to perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis has been sparsely investigated in humans and the findings are inconsistent. Objectives A matched case-control study was conducted to investigate the association between fetal exposure to PFCs and ADHD diagnosis in childhood. Methods The study base comprised children born in Malm\"o, Sweden, between 1978 and 2000 that were followed up until 2005. Children with ADHD (n = 206) were identified at the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Controls (n = 206) were selected from the study base and were matched for year of birth and maternal country of birth. PFC concentrations were measured in umbilical cord serum samples. The differences of the PFC concentrations between cases and controls were investigated using Wilcoxon's paired test. Possible threshold effects (above the upper quartile for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and above limit of detection [LOD] for perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA)) were evaluated by conditional logistic regression. Results The median umbilical cord serum concentrations of PFOS were 6.92 ng/ml in the cases and 6.77 ng/ml in the controls. The corresponding concentrations of PFOA were 1.80 and 1.83 ng/ml. No associations between PFCs and ADHD were observed. Odds ratios adjusted for smoking status, parity, and gestational age were 0.81 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.50 to 1.32) for PFOS, 1.07 (95\% CI 0.67 to 1.7) for PFOA, and 1.1 (95\% CI 0.75 to 1.7) for PFNA. Conclusions The current study revealed no support for an association between fetal exposure to PFOS, PFOA, or PFNA and ADHD.},

Elucidation of the mechanism that regulates the counts of the WBC subtypes would provide useful insights into both the etiology of the immune system and disease pathogenesis. In this study, we report results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and a replication study for the counts of the 5 main WBC subtypes (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils) using 14,792 Japanese subjects enrolled in the BioBank Japan Project. We identified 12 significantly associated loci that satisfied the genome-wide significance threshold of P{$<$}5.0\texttimes 10-8, of which 9 loci were novel (the CDK6 locus for the neutrophil count; the ITGA4, MLZE, STXBP6 loci, and the MHC region for the monocyte count; the SLC45A3-NUCKS1, GATA2, NAALAD2, ERG loci for the basophil count). We further evaluated associations in the identified loci using 15,600 subjects from Caucasian populations. These WBC subtype-related loci demonstrated a variety of patterns of pleiotropic associations within the WBC subtypes, or with total WBC count, platelet count, or red blood cell-related traits (n = 30,454), which suggests unique and common functional roles of these loci in the processes of hematopoiesis. This study should contribute to the understanding of the genetic backgrounds of the WBC subtypes and hematological traits.},

The Peg10 knockout mice showed early embryonic lethality owing to defects in the placenta. This indicates that Peg10 is critical for mouse parthenogenetic development and provides the first direct evidence of an essential role of an evolutionarily conserved retrotransposon-derived gene in mammalian development.},

Human epidemiological studies of exposure-related deviations of children's behaviors are sparse. We assessed the associations between prenatal, 5- and 7-year PFAS exposures and behavioral problem scores in 7-year Faroese children. Methods Concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) were measured in maternal serum and in serum from children at ages 5 and 7 years (n=539, 508, and 491, respectively). We used multivariable regressions and structural equations models to estimate the covariate-adjusted associations between serum-PFAS concentrations and behavioral difficulties, as assessed by the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ) at age 7. Results Serum-PFOS and PFHxS concentrations declined over time, whereas PFOA, PFNA, and PFDA tended to increase. No associations were observed between prenatal PFAS concentrations and SDQ scores. However, a two-fold increase in 5-year serum-PFOA, PFNA, and PFDA concentrations was associated with increases in total SDQ scores by 1.03 (95\% CI: 0.11, 1.95), 0.72 (95\% CI: 0.07, 1.38) and 0.78 points (95\% CI: 0.01, 1.55), respectively. For SDQ subscales, significant associations were found in regard to hyperactivity, peer relationship, and conduct problems, as well as internalizing and externalizing problems and autism screening composite scores. Cross-sectional analyses at age 7 years showed possible sex-dimorphic associations between PFAS concentrations and SDQ scores, where girls had consistently positive associations with SDQ scores whereas boys exhibited a pattern of negative or null associations. Conclusions Higher serum PFAS concentrations at ages 5- and 7-years, but not prenatally, were associated with parent-reported behavioral problems at age 7.},

  abstract = {Background: Exposure to organophosphate pesticides has been associated with neurobehavioral deficits in children, although data on low levels of exposure experienced by the general population are sparse. Pyrethroids are insecticides rapidly gaining popularity, and epidemiological evidence on their potential effects is lacking.Objective: We examined the association between exposure to organophosphate and pyrethroid pesticides, indicated by urinary metabolites, and parentally reported behavioral problems in children.Methods: We used data on children 6\textendash 11 years of age from the Canadian Health Measures Survey (2007\textendash 2009). We used logistic regressions to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for high scores on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), which may indicate behavioral problems, in association with concentrations of pyrethroid and organophosphate metabolites in the urine of 779 children, adjusting for covariates (sex, age, race/ethnicity, income, parental education, blood lead levels, maternal smoking during pregnancy, and others).Results: At least one urinary metabolite for organophosphates was detected in 91\% of children, and for pyrethroids in 97\% of children. Organophosphate metabolites were not significantly associated with high SDQ scores. The pyrethroid metabolite cis-DCCA [3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethylycyclopropane carboxylic acid] was significantly associated with high scores for total difficulties on the SDQ (OR for a 10-fold increase = 2.0; 95\% CI: 1.1, 3.6), and there was a nonsignificant association with trans-DCCA (OR = 1.6; 95\% CI: 0.9, 3.0).Conclusion: In contrast with previous studies, we did not observe an association between exposure to organophosphate pesticides and behavioral scores in children. However, some pyrethroid urinary metabolites were associated with a high level of parent-reported behavioral problems.

  abstract = {The inappropriate programming of developing organ systems by exposure to excess native or environmental steroids, particularly the contamination of our environment and our food sources with synthetic endocrine disrupting chemicals that can interact with steroid receptors, is a major concern. Studies with native steroids have found that in utero exposure of sheep to excess testosterone, an oestrogen precursor, results in low birth weight offspring and leads to an array of adult reproductive/metabolic deficits manifested as cycle defects, functional hyperandrogenism, neuroendocrine/ovarian defects, insulin resistance and hypertension. Furthermore, the severity of reproductive dysfunction is amplified by excess postnatal weight gain. The constellation of adult reproductive and metabolic dysfunction in prenatal testosterone-treated sheep is similar to features seen in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Prenatal dihydrotestosterone treatment failed to result in similar phenotype suggesting that many effects of prenatal testosterone excess are likely facilitated via aromatization to oestradiol. Similarly, exposure to environmental steroid imposters such as bisphenol A (BPA) and methoxychlor (MXC) from days 30 to 90 of gestation had long-term but differential effects. Exposure of sheep to BPA, which resulted in maternal levels of 30-50 ng/mL BPA, culminated in low birth weight offspring. These female offspring were hypergonadotropic during early postnatal life and characterized by severely dampened preovulatory LH surges. Prenatal MXC-treated females had normal birth weight and manifested delayed but normal amplitude LH surges. Importantly, the effects of BPA were evident at levels, which approximated twice the highest levels found in human maternal circulation of industrialized nations. These findings provide evidence in support of developmental origin of adult reproductive and metabolic diseases and highlight the risk posed by exposure to environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals.},

During fetal life the intrauterine environment is critical for the normal development, and even small changes in the levels of hormones, such as estradiol or estrogen-mimicking chemicals, can lead to changes in brain function and consequently in behavior. We review here a series of ethological studies on the effects of maternal oral exposure during the last part of gestation (prenatal exposure) or from gestation day 11 to postnatal day 7 (perinatal exposure) to a low, environmentally relevant dose of BPA (10{$\mu$}g/kg bw/day) on behavioral responses of CD-1 mouse offspring. We examined both male and female offspring and found that maternal exposure to BPA affected: (1) behavioral responses to novelty before puberty and, as adults; (2) exploration and activity in a free-exploratory open field; (3) exploration in the elevated plus maze and (4) sensitivity to amphetamine-induced reward in the conditioned place preference test. A consistent effect of the maternal exposure to BPA is that in all these different experimental settings, while a significant sex difference was observed in the control group, exposure to BPA decreased or eliminated the sex difference in behavior. In addition, exposure of female mice to BPA in both adulthood or during fetal life altered subsequent maternal behavior.

  abstract = {Allele-specific DNA methylation (ASM) is well studied in imprinted domains, but this type of epigenetic asymmetry is actually found more commonly at non-imprinted loci, where the ASM is dictated not by parent-of-origin but instead by the local haplotype. We identified loci with strong ASM in human tissues from methylation-sensitive SNP array data. Two index regions (bisulfite PCR amplicons), one between the C3orf27 and RPN1 genes in chromosome band 3q21 and the other near the VTRNA2-1 vault RNA in band 5q31, proved to be new examples of imprinted DMRs (maternal alleles methylated) while a third, between STEAP3 and C2orf76 in chromosome band 2q14, showed non-imprinted haplotype-dependent ASM. Using long-read bisulfite sequencing (bis-seq) in 8 human tissues we found that in all 3 domains the ASM is restricted to single differentially methylated regions (DMRs), each less than 2kb. The ASM in the C3orf27-RPN1 intergenic region was placentaspecific and associated with allele-specific expression of a long non-coding RNA. Strikingly, the discrete DMRs in all 3 regions overlap with binding sites for the insulator protein CTCF, which we found selectively bound to the unmethylated allele of the STEAP3-C2orf76 DMR. Methylation mapping in two additional genes with non-imprinted haplotype-dependent ASM, ELK3 and CYP2A7, showed that the CYP2A7 DMR also overlaps a CTCF site. Thus, two features of imprinted domains, highly localized DMRs and allele-specific insulator occupancy by CTCF, can also be found in chromosomal domains with nonimprinted ASM. Arguing for biological importance, our analysis of published whole genome bis-seq data from hES cells revealed multiple genome-wide association study (GWAS) peaks near CTCF binding sites with ASM.},

  abstract = {The placenta regulates the in utero environment and functionally impacts fetal development. Candidate gene studies identified variation in placental DNA methylation is associated with newborn neurologic and behavioral outcomes including movement quality, lethargic behavior, attention, and arousal. We sought to identify novel regions of variable DNA methylation associated with newborn attention, lethargy, quality of movement, and arousal by performing an epigenome-wide association study in 335 infants from a US birth cohort. Methylation status was quantified using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array and associations to newborn outcomes assessed by the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scales (NNNS) were identified while incorporating established bioinformatics algorithms to control for confounding by cell type composition. Methylation of CpGs within FHIT (cg15970800) and ANKRD11 (cg16710656) demonstrated genome-wide significance (P {$<$} 1.8 \texttimes{} 10(-7)) in specific associations with infant attention. CpGs whose differential methylation was associated with all 4 neurobehavioral outcomes were common to 50 genes involved in biological processes relating to cellular adhesion and nervous system development. Comprehensive methylation profiling identified relationships between methylation of FHIT and ANKRD11, which have been previously linked to neurodevelopment and behavioral outcomes in genetic association studies. Subtle changes in DNA methylation of these genes within the placenta may impact normal variation of a newborn's ability to alter and track visual and auditory stimuli. Gene ontology analysis suggested that those genes with variable methylation related to these outcomes are over-represented in biological pathways involved in brain development and placental physiology, supportive of our hypothesis for a key role of the placenta in neurobehavioral outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background: Microarray technology allows the monitoring of expression levels for thousands of genes simultaneously. This novel technique helps us to understand gene regulation as well as gene by gene interactions more systematically. In the microarray experiment, however, many undesirable systematic variations are observed. Even in replicated experiment, some variations are commonly observed. Normalization is the process of removing some sources of variation which affect the measured gene expression levels. Although a number of normalization methods have been proposed, it has been difficult to decide which methods perform best. Normalization plays an important role in the earlier stage of microarray data analysis. The subsequent analysis results are highly dependent on normalization. Results: In this paper, we use the variability among the replicated slides to compare performance of normalization methods. We also compare normalization methods with regard to bias and mean square error using simulated data. Conclusions: Our results show that intensity-dependent normalization often performs better than global normalization methods, and that linear and nonlinear normalization methods perform similarly. These conclusions are based on analysis of 36 cDNA microarrays of 3,840 genes obtained in an experiment to search for changes in gene expression profiles during neuronal differentiation of cortical stem cells. Simulation studies confirm our findings.},

We propose a quantitative measure of the total cost of a monitoring program, and study a detection system that is designed to minimize it, subject to a constraint in the number of terrorists the agency wishes to capture. In the absence of real, accurate behavioral models, we perform our analysis on the basis of several simple but insightful examples. With these examples, we illustrate the different parameters involved in the design of the detection system, and provide some indicative and representative figures of the cost of the monitoring program.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and other chronic diseases are caused by a complex combination of many genetic and environmental factors. Few methods are available to comprehensively associate specific physical environmental factors with disease. We conducted a pilot Environmental-Wide Association Study (EWAS), in which epidemiological data are comprehensively and systematically interpreted in a manner analogous to a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS). METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed multiple cross-sectional analyses associating 266 unique environmental factors with clinical status for T2D defined by fasting blood sugar (FBG) concentration {$>$} or =126 mg/dL. We utilized available Centers for Disease Control (CDC) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cohorts from years 1999 to 2006. Within cohort sample numbers ranged from 503 to 3,318. Logistic regression models were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), ethnicity, and an estimate of socioeconomic status (SES). As in GWAS, multiple comparisons were controlled and significant findings were validated with other cohorts. We discovered significant associations for the pesticide-derivative heptachlor epoxide (adjusted OR in three combined cohorts of 1.7 for a 1 SD change in exposure amount; p{$<$}0.001), and the vitamin gamma-tocopherol (adjusted OR 1.5; p{$<$}0.001). Higher concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) such as PCB170 (adjusted OR 2.2; p{$<$}0.001) were also found. Protective factors associated with T2D included beta-carotenes (adjusted OR 0.6; p{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Despite difficulty in ascertaining causality, the potential for novel factors of large effect associated with T2D justify the use of EWAS to create hypotheses regarding the broad contribution of the environment to disease. Even in this study based on prior collected epidemiological measures, environmental factors can be found with effect sizes comparable to the best loci yet found by GWAS.},

Time-pregnant Long-Evans rats received TCS po (0-300mg/kg/day) from gestational day (GD) 6 through postnatal day (PND) 21. Serum and liver were collected from dams (GD20, PND22) and offspring (GD20, PND4, PND14, PND21). Serum T4, triiodothyronine (T3), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay. Ethoxy-O-deethylase (EROD), pentoxyresorufin-O-depentylase (PROD) and uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferase (UGT) enzyme activities were measured in liver microsomes. Custom Taqman(\textregistered ) qPCR arrays were employed to measure hepatic mRNA expression of select cytochrome P450s, UGTs, sulfotransferases, transporters, and thyroid hormone-responsive genes. TCS was quantified by LC/MS/MS in serum and liver. Serum T4 decreased approximately 30\% in GD20 dams and fetuses, PND4 pups and PND22 dams (300mg/kg/day). Hepatic PROD activity increased 2-3 fold in PND4 pups and PND22 dams, and UGT activity was 1.5 fold higher in PND22 dams only (300mg/kg/day). Minor up-regulation of Cyp2b and Cyp3a expression in dams was consistent with hypothesized activation of the constitutive androstane and/or pregnane X receptor. T4 reductions of 30\% for dams and GD20 and PND4 offspring with concomitant increases in PROD (PND4 neonates and PND22 dams) and UGT activity (PND22 dams) suggest that up-regulated hepatic catabolism may contribute to TCS-induced hypothyroxinemia during development. Serum and liver TCS concentrations demonstrated greater fetal than postnatal internal exposure, consistent with the lack of T4 changes in PND14 and PND21 offspring. These data support the MOA hypothesis that TCS exposure leads to hypothyroxinemia via increased hepatic catabolism; however, the minor effects on thyroid hormone metabolism may reflect the low efficacy of TCS as thyroid hormone disruptor or highlight the possibility that other MOAs may also contribute to the observed maternal and early neonatal hypothyroxinemia.},

Individuals with missing data may differ from those with no missing data in terms of the outcome of interest and prognosis in general. Missing data are often categorized into the following three types: missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing not at random (MNAR). In clinical epidemiological research, missing data are seldom MCAR. Missing data can constitute considerable challenges in the analyses and interpretation of results and can potentially weaken the validity of results and conclusions. A number of methods have been developed for dealing with missing data. These include complete-case analyses, missing indicator method, single value imputation, and sensitivity analyses incorporating worst-case and best-case scenarios. If applied under the MCAR assumption, some of these methods can provide unbiased but often less precise estimates. Multiple imputation is an alternative method to deal with missing data, which accounts for the uncertainty associated with missing data. Multiple imputation is implemented in most statistical software under the MAR assumption and provides unbiased and valid estimates of associations based on information from the available data. The method affects not only the coefficient estimates for variables with missing data but also the estimates for other variables with no missing data.},

However, it is not known if developmental exposure to low, environmentally relevant doses of xenoestrogens alters adult bone geometry and strength. In this study we investigated the effects of developmental exposure to low doses of DES, bisphenol A (BPA), or ethinyl estradiol (EE(2)) on bone geometry and torsional strength. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to DES, 0.1 {$\mu$}g/kg/day, BPA, 10 {$\mu$}g/kg/day, EE(2), 0.01, 0.1, or 1.0 {$\mu$}g/kg/day, or vehicle from Gestation Day 11 to Postnatal Day 12 via a mini-osmotic pump in the dam. Developmental Xenoestrogen exposure altered femoral geometry and strength, assessed in adulthood by micro-computed tomography and torsional strength analysis, respectively. Low-dose EE(2), DES, or BPA increased adult femur length. Exposure to the highest dose of EE(2) did not alter femur length, resulting in a nonmonotonic dose response. Exposure to EE(2) and DES but not BPA decreased tensile strength. The combined effect of increased femur length and decreased tensile strength resulted in a trend toward decreased torsional ultimate strength and energy to failure. Taken together, these results suggest that exposure to developmental exposure to environmentally relevant levels of xenoestrogens may negatively impact bone length and strength in adulthood.},

This review is based on past and current research that compares the feasibility and testing of the placenta-on-a-chip microengineered model to the previous and underdeveloped in vivo and ex vivo approaches. The testing of the practicality and effectiveness of the in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo models requires the experimentation of prominent pharmaceutical drugs that most mothers consume during pregnancy. In this case, these drugs need to be studied and tested more often. However, there are challenges associated with the in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo processes when developing a practical placental model, which are discussed in further detail.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phthalates, used in a variety of consumer products, are a group of chemicals that are ubiquitous in the environment, and their metabolites are detectable in most humans. Some phthalates have anti-androgenic properties; a prior study reported an association between gestational exposure to phthalates and reduced masculine behaviors in preschool boys. METHODS: Concentrations of 9 phthalate metabolites were measured in urine collected at 16 and 26~weeks' gestation from pregnant women enrolled in the HOME Study, a prospective pregnancy and birth cohort. Measures of gender-related play were collected at 8~years of age, including the Gender Identity Questionnaire (GIQ) completed by mothers, and the Playmate and Play Style Preferences Structured Interview (PPPSI) completed by children. We examined these measures as continuous variables using both bivariate and multivariable approaches with adjustment for covariates. Additional analyses included logistic regression of GIQ and PPPSI scores dichotomized by sex at the lower 25th percentile, indicating the least typical behavior. RESULTS: Mothers' phthalate metabolite concentrations during pregnancy were similar to the reported national average among US women. All children scored within a typical range on both measures of gender-related play behavior. No statistically significant associations were found between averaged maternal phthalate metabolite concentrations and continuous PPPSI scores or any GIQ scores. For the dichotomized PPPSI; higher maternal monoethyl phthalate (MEP) concentrations were associated with more typical play behaviors for females (OR\,=\,0.70, CI\,=\,0.51-0.97). In contrast, higher maternal mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP) concentrations were associated with higher odds of membership in the least typical play behaviors group for males (OR\,=\,1.69, CI\,=\,1.00-2.86). CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of typically developing children, higher maternal urinary MEP concentrations during pregnancy were associated with more typical gender-related play behaviors in both males and females, and increased urinary MiBP concentrations were associated with less masculine gender-related play behaviors in males.},

The primordial germ cells, embryo, and fetus are highly susceptible to epigenetic dysregulation by environmental chemicals, which can thereby exert multiple adverse effects. The data reviewed here on environmental contaminants have potential implications for risk assessment although more data are needed on individual susceptibility to epigenetic alterations and their persistence before this information can be used in formal risk assessments. The findings discussed indicate that identification of environmental chemicals that dysregulate the prenatal epigenome should be a priority in health research and disease prevention.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Experimental laboratory evidence suggests that bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor, is a neurodevelopmental toxicant. However, there have been limited and inconclusive results with respect to sex-specific BPA effects on child behavior. OBJECTIVE: We examined the association between prenatal BPA exposure and child behavior, adjusting for postnatal BPA exposure and hypothesizing sex-specific effects. METHODS: We followed African-American and Dominican women and their children from pregnancy to child's age 5 years, collecting spot urine samples from the mothers during pregnancy (34 weeks on average) and from children between 3 and 4 years of age to estimate BPA exposure. We assessed child behavior between 3 and 5 years of age using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and used generalized linear models to test the association between BPA exposure and child behavior, adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: The analysis was conducted on 198 children (87 boys and 111 girls). Among boys, high prenatal BPA exposure (highest quartile vs. the lowest three quartiles) was associated with significantly higher CBCL scores (more problems) on Emotionally Reactive [1.62 times greater; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.13, 2.32] and Aggressive Behavior syndromes (1.29 times greater; 95\% CI: 1.09, 1.53). Among girls, higher exposure was associated with lower scores on all syndromes, reaching statistical significance for Anxious/Depressed (0.75 times as high; 95\% CI: 0.57, 0.99) and Aggressive Behavior (0.82 times as high; 95\% CI: 0.70, 0.97). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that prenatal exposure to BPA may affect child behavior, and differently among boys and girls.},

We previously reported that a broad spectrum of combustion-related DNA adducts in cord blood was associated with attention problems at 6-7 years of age in the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health (CCCEH) longitudinal cohort study. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the relationship between behavioral problems and two different measures of prenatal exposure--both specific to PAH--in the same cohort. METHODS: Children of nonsmoking African-American and Dominican women in New York City (NYC) were followed from in utero to 6-7 years. Prenatal PAH exposure was estimated by personal air monitoring of the mothers during pregnancy as well as by the measurement of DNA adducts specific to benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), a representative PAH, in maternal and cord blood. At 6-7 years of age, child behavior was assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (n = 253). Generalized linear models were used to test the association between prenatal PAH exposure and behavioral outcomes. RESULTS: In multivariate analyses, high prenatal PAH exposure, whether characterized by personal air monitoring (greater than the median of 2.27 ng/m{$^3$}) or maternal and cord adducts (detectable or higher), was positively associated with symptoms of Anxious/Depressed and Attention Problems (p {$\leq$} 0.05). CONCLUSION: These results provide additional evidence that environmental levels of PAH encountered in NYC air can adversely affect child behavior.},

We previously reported a positive association between prenatal BPA exposure and symptoms of anxiety/depression reported by the mother at child age 7-9 years in boys, but not girls. OBJECTIVES: Here, in the same birth cohort, we investigated the association of prenatal BPA exposure with symptoms of depression and anxiety self-reported by the 10-12 year olds, hypothesizing that we would observe sex-specific differences in anxiety and depressive symptoms. METHODS: African-American and Dominican women living in Northern Manhattan and their children were followed from mother's pregnancy through children's age 10-12 years. BPA was quantified in maternal urine collected during the third trimester of pregnancy and in child urine collected at ages 3 and 5 years. Children were evaluated using the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS) and Children's Depression Rating Scale (CDRS). We compared the children in the highest tertile of BPA concentration to those in the lower two tertiles. Associations between behavior and prenatal (maternal) BPA concentration or postnatal (child) BPA concentration were assessed in regression models stratified by sex. RESULTS: Significant positive associations between prenatal BPA and symptoms of depression and anxiety were observed among boys. Postnatal BPA exposure was not significantly associated with outcomes. There was substantial co-occurrence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in this sample. CONCLUSION: These results provide evidence that prenatal BPA exposure is associated with more symptoms of anxiety and depression in boys but not in girls at age 10-12 years.},

This work investigates the comparative toxicity and ability to interfere with the synthesis of steroids and to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) of a selected number of plasticizers, including bisphenol A (BPA), nonyl- (NP) and octylphenol (OP), benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) and dimethyl phthalate (DMP), in the human placenta JEG-3 cells. Moreover, the bioavailability of chemicals in culture medium has been investigated. After 24h exposure, OP and NP showed the highest cytotoxicity (EC50: 36\textendash 40{$\mu$}M) followed by BPA (138\textendash 219{$\mu$}M), whereas no significant toxicity was observed for phthalates. Notwithstanding, BBP and DBP significantly decreased P450 aromatase activity (experimental IC50: 14\textendash 15{$\mu$}M), while NP and OP (20{$\mu$}M) increased the activity. Overall, this study evidences the differential toxicity and ability to modulate placental aromatase activity of some of the compounds nowadays used as plasticizers, and highlights the need of an accurate determination of the bioavailability of chemicals to improve the sensitivity of in-vitro tests.},

According to a recent systematic review, the worldwide estimate of ADHD prevalence is 7.2\% in children. This study aims to assess the prevalence of ADHD diagnoses in 2017 and the incidence of ADHD diagnoses in 2009-2017 in children living in Catalonia, Spain, as well as their temporal and geographical variability, and stratifying by sex and age. We used administrative data for all children aged 4 to 17 years who were insured in the public Catalan Health System in 2009-2017. We identified all ADHD cases diagnosed in 2009-2017 (ICD-9 code 314). We estimated the prevalence of ADHD diagnoses in 2017 and the overall annual incidence of ADHD diagnoses in 2009-2017. We used Poisson regression models to assess temporal trends in the incidence. We estimated a prevalence of ADHD diagnoses of 4.06\% (95\%CI 4.03, 4.10) in 2017, being 5.81\% (95\%CI 5.75, 5.87) for boys and 2.20\% (95\%CI 2.16, 2.24) for girls, the highest prevalence being in 13-to-17-year-olds (7.28\% (95\%CI 7.20, 7.36)). We did not observe a statistically significant increase of the incidence of ADHD diagnoses during the study period. Geographical differences were found across the healthcare areas in both prevalence and annual incidence and constant during the study period. In conclusion, the prevalence of ADHD diagnoses observed in this study was 4.06\%, which was lower than the estimates reported in previous systematic reviews, but in line with the prevalence estimates from other recent European studies. The prevalence was higher in boys than girls, with a sex ratio consistent with previous studies. We did not observe an increase in the temporal trend of incidence of ADHD diagnoses in recent years, but we found geographical differences.},

The objective is to characterize the ability of within-subject pooling of biospecimens to reduce bias due to exposure misclassification when within-subject variability in biomarker concentrations is high. Methods: We considered chemicals with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.6 and 0.2. In a simulation study, we hypothesized that the chemical urinary concentrations averaged over a given time period were associated with a health outcome and estimated the bias of studies assessing exposure that collected 1 to 50 random biospecimens per subject. We assumed a classical type error. We studied associations using a within-subject pooling approach and two measurement error models (simulation extrapolation and regression calibration), the latter requiring the assay of more than one biospecimen per subject. Results: For both continuous and binary outcomes, using one sample led to attenuation bias of 40\% and 80\% for compounds with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.6 and 0.2, respectively. For a compound with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.6, the numbers of biospecimens required to limit bias to less than 10\% were 6, 2, and 2 biospecimens with the pooling, simulation extrapolation, and regression calibration methods (these values were, respectively, 35, 8, and 2 for a compound with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.2). Compared with pooling, these methods did not improve power. Conclusion: Within-subject pooling limits attenuation bias without increasing assay costs. Simulation extrapolation and regression},

This study aimed to determine the associations of trace elements with lipid profiles and glycaemic control in patients with T1DM. A total of 192 patients with T1DM who attended the Unit of Diabetology and Metabolic Diseases in Sassari, Italy, were enrolled. Trace elements zinc, copper, selenium, chromium, and iron were measured in whole blood by sector field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The correlations between metabolic variables and the levels of trace elements were determined. Zinc was positively correlated with total cholesterol (P=0.023), low-density lipoprotein (P=0.0015), and triglycerides (P=0.027). Iron as significantly correlated with TC (P=0.0189), LDL (P=0.0121), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (P=0.0466). In males, Cr was positively correlated with HDL (P=0.0079) and Se, in females was correlated with TG (P=0.0113). The mean fasting plasma glucose was166.2mgdL(-1). Chromium was correlated with fasting plasma glucose (P=0.0149), particularly in males (P=0.0038). Overall, 63.5\% of the patients had moderate HbA1c (7-9\%). Copper was significantly correlated with HbA1c\% in males (P=0.0155). In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that trace elements show different associations with lipid levels and glycaemic control in T1DM.

Molecular signatures after childhood malnutrition, including the potential for intergenerational transmission, remain unexplored. Methods\textemdash We surveyed blood DNA methylomes (\textasciitilde 483,000 individual CpG sites) in 168 subjects across two generations (G1,G2), including 50 G1 individuals hospitalized during the first year of life for moderate to severe protein energy malnutrition, then followed up to 48 years in the Barbados Nutrition Study.

Expression of nutrition-sensitive genes was explored by qRT-PCR in rat prefrontal cortex. Results\textemdash We identified altogether 134 nutrition-sensitive differentially methylated genomic regions (DMR), with the overwhelming majority (87\%) specific for G1. Multiple neuropsychiatric risk genes, including COMT, IFNG, MIR200B, SYNGAP1 and VIP2R showed associations of specific methyl-CpGs with attention and IQ. Interferon Gamma (IFNG) expression was decreased in prefrontal cortex of rats showing attention deficits after developmental malnutrition.

  abstract = {Background: The identification and characterisation of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between phenotypes in the human genome is of prime interest in epigenetics. We present a novel method, DMRcate, that fits replicated methylation measurements from the Illumina HM450K BeadChip (or 450K array) spatially across the genome using a Gaussian kernel. DMRcate identifies and ranks the most differentially methylated regions across the genome based on tunable kernel smoothing of the differential methylation (DM) signal. The method is agnostic to both genomic annotation and local change in the direction of the DM signal, removes the bias incurred from irregularly spaced methylation sites, and assigns significance to each DMR called via comparison to a null model. Results: We show that, for both simulated and real data, the predictive performance of DMRcate is superior to those of Bumphunter and Probe Lasso, and commensurate with that of comb-p. For the real data, we validate all array-derived DMRs from the candidate methods on a suite of DMRs derived from whole-genome bisulfite sequencing called from the same DNA samples, using two separate phenotype comparisons. Conclusions: The agglomeration of genomically localised individual methylation sites into discrete DMRs is currently best served by a combination of DM-signal smoothing and subsequent threshold specification. The findings also suggest the design of the 450K array shows preference for CpG sites that are more likely to be differentially methylated, but its overall coverage does not adequately reflect the depth and complexity of methylation signatures afforded by sequencing. For the convenience of the research community we have created a user-friendly R software package called DMRcate, downloadable from Bioconductor and compatible with existing preprocessing packages, which allows others to apply the same DMR-finding method on 450K array data.},

Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), the most abundant chemical used in plastic materials, is known to induce toxicity on animals reproductive system and is suspected to give rise to similar effect in humans. Toxicity of DEHP is due to its main metabolite, MEHP, which is also known to disturb lipid synthesis in several organs. Moreover, mono-(2-ethylhexyl)phtalate (MEHP) is a high affinity ligand of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPAR{$\gamma$} which is essential for placental development and lipid metabolism. In order to investigate possible lipid disruptions induced by MEHP, in the JEG-3 human trophoblast cell line, a differential lipidomic analysis was carried out by UPLC-MS on both exposed and control cells. Our results showed that MEHP induced an important change of JEG-3 cells lipidome, especially in glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids, with a marked accumulation of triacylglycerols. For the first time, our results highlighted adverse effects of MEHP on human placental cells lipidome and thus, its potential effect on placental physiology.},

  abstract = {Background: Maternal urinary biomarkers are often used to assess fetal exposure to phenols and their precursors. Their effectiveness as a measure of exposure in epidemiological studies depends on their variability during pregnancy and their ability to accurately predict fetal exposure. Objectives: We assessed the relationship between urinary and amniotic fluid concentrations of nine environmental phenols, and the reproducibility of urinary concentrations, among pregnant women. Methods: Seventy-one women referred for amniocentesis were included. Maternal urine was collected at the time of the amniocentesis appointment and on two subsequent occasions. Urine and amniotic fluid were analyzed for 2,4- and 2,5-dichlorophenols, bisphenol A, benzophenone-3, triclosan, and methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, and butylparabens using online solid phase extraction\textendash high performance liquid chromatography\textendash isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry. Results: Only benzophenone-3 and propylparaben were detectable in more than half of the amniotic fluid samples; for these phenols, concentrations in amniotic fluid and maternal urine collected on the same day were positively correlated ({$\rho$} = 0.53 and 0.32, respectively). Other phenols were detected infrequently in amniotic fluid (e.g., bisphenol A was detected in only two samples). The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of urinary concentrations in samples from individual women ranged from 0.48 to 0.62 for all phenols except bisphenol A (ICC = 0.11). Conclusion: Amniotic fluid detection frequencies for most phenols were low. The reproducibility of urine measures was poor for bisphenol A, but good for the other phenols. Although a single sample may provide a reasonable estimate of exposure for some phenols, collecting multiple urine samples during pregnancy is an option to reduce exposure measurement error in studies regarding the effects of phenol prenatal exposure on health.},

Objectives We studied the associations of maternal exposure to phenols during pregnancy with prenatal and postnatal growth of male newborns. Methods Within a cohort of women recruited during pregnancy, we selected 520 mother\textendash son pairs and quantified 9 phenols in spot urine samples collected during pregnancy. We used ultrasonography during pregnancy, together with birth measurements, to assess fetal growth. We modeled individual postnatal growth trajectories from repeated measures of weight and height in the first 3 years of life. Results Triclosan concentration was negatively associated with growth parameters measured at the third ultrasound examination but not earlier in pregnancy. At birth, this phenol tended to be negatively associated with head circumference (-1.2 mm for an interquartile range [IQR] increase in ln-transformed triclosan concentration [95\% confidence interval = -2.6 to 0.3]) but not with weight or height. Parabens were positively associated with weight at birth. This positive association remained for 3 years for methylparaben ({$\beta$} = 193 g [-4 to 389]) for an IQR increase in ln-transformed concentrations. Conclusion We relied on only 1 spot urine sample to assess exposure; because of the high variability in phenol urinary concentrations reported during pregnancy, using only 1 sample may result in exposure misclassification, in particular for bisphenol A. Our study suggested associations between prenatal exposure to parabens and triclosan and prenatal or early postnatal growth.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Organophosphates are widely used pesticides that have been shown to affect child neurodevelopment. Previous studies that explored their potential effects on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) relied either on proxies of external exposure or on questionnaires completed by the parents to identify autism-like behaviors but did not provide a clinical diagnosis of ASD. AIMS: We studied the associations between prenatal biologic markers for exposure to organophosphate pesticides and the risk of having a child with ASD or other developmental concerns (ODC). METHOD: We analyzed 203 mother-child pairs of the ongoing MARBLES (Markers of Autism Risk in Babies - Learning Early Signs) mother-child cohort, which enrolls mothers who are either pregnant or planning a pregnancy and whose expected child has an elevated risk to develop ASD. Seven metabolites of organophosphate pesticides were assessed in repeated urine samples collected during pregnancy. At 36 months, children were assessed with intruments measuring cognitive function and adaptive behaviors, and with two gold-standard diagnostic instruments for ASD: the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised. Children were classified in one of the following groups: ASD (n = 46), ODC (n = 55) and typically developing (TD, n = 102). RESULTS: After adjustment for potential confounders, organophosphate metabolite concentrations were not associated with an increased risk of ASD or ODC when boys and girls were studied together. After stratification by sex, dimethylthiophosphate (DMTP) pregnancy concentration tended to be associated with an increased ASD risk among girls (OR for a doubling in the DMTP concentration: 1.64 (95\%CI, 0.95; 2.82)) but not among boys (OR: 0.84, 95\%CI: 0.63; 1.11). DISCUSSION: This is the first study of clinically confirmed diagnoses of ASD that utilized repeated measurements of organophosphate metabolites during pregnancy to explore the associations between these pesticides and ASD risk in children. The association we observed among girls, as well as the lack of association in boys, need to be replicated in further studies with similar design and larger sample size. In light of the higher baseline risk for ASD in this cohort, generalizability to children lacking a first degree relative affected by ASD is unknown.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The placenta performs crucial physiological functions to ensure normal fetal development. Few epidemiological studies investigated placental weight sensitivity to phthalates and phenols. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to explore whether maternal exposure to select phthalates and phenols is associated with changes in placental weight at birth and in placental\textendash to\textendash birth weight ratio (PFR). METHODS: Placental weight and birth weight were available for 473 mother\textendash son pairs in the EDEN (Etude des D\'eterminants pr\'e et postnatals du d\'eveloppement et de la sant\'e de l'Enfant) cohort for whom 9 phenols (4 parabens, 2 dichlorophenols, triclosan, benzophenone-3, bisphenol A) and 11 phthalate metabolites were measured in spot urine samples collected between weeks 23 and 29 of gestation. We used adjusted Elastic Net penalized regression models (ENET) to select biomarkers associated with placental weight, birth weight and PFR. Unpenalized effect estimates were then obtained by fitting linear regression models simultaneously adjusted for the ENET-selected biomarkers and a priori chosen confounders. RESULTS: The multipollutant ENET model for placental weight retained four biomarkers: triclosan and monocarboxy-isononyl phthalate (MCNP), which were negatively associated with placental weight, and benzophenone-3 and the sum of parabens, which were positively associated with this outcome. The ENET model for PFR retained two phthalate metabolites [MCNP and monocarboxy-isooctyl phthalate (MCOP)], which were negatively associated with this outcome. DISCUSSION: The positive association between the sum of parabens and placental weight was consistent with results of a previous study among 49 male births. Our results provide preliminary evidence of possible associations between other compounds such as triclosan, benzophenone-3, MCNP, and MCOP and both placental weight and PFR. These associations were not reported in previous studies and should be seen as hypothesis generating. Studies relying on repeated assessments of exposure in prospective mother\textendash child cohorts are needed to substantiate the plausibility of the hypotheses generated by our results. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP3523.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In biomarker-based studies, collecting repeated biospecimens per participant can decrease measurement error, particularly for biomarkers displaying high within-subject variability. Guidelines to combine such repeated biospecimens do not exist. AIMS: To compare the efficiency of several designs relying on repeated biospecimens to estimate exposure over 7 days. METHODS: We quantified triclosan and bisphenol A (BPA) in all urine voids (N~=~427) collected over seven days from eight individuals. We estimated the volume-weighted concentrations for all urine samples collected during a week and compared these gold standards with the concentrations obtained for equal-volume pools (standardized or not for urine dilution), unequal-volume pools (based on sample volume or creatinine concentration), and for the mean of the creatinine-standardized concentrations measured in each spot sample. RESULTS: For both chemicals, correlations with gold standards were similar for equal- and unequal-volume pooling designs. Only for BPA, correlation coefficients were markedly lower after standardization for specific gravity or creatinine of concentrations estimated in equal-volume pools. Averaging BPA creatinine-standardized concentrations measured in each spot sample led also to lower correlations with gold standards compared to those obtained for unstandardized pooling designs. CONCLUSION: For BPA and triclosan, considering individual urine sample volume or creatinine concentrations when pooling is unnecessary because equal-volume pool adequately estimates concentrations in gold standards. Standardization for specific gravity or creatinine of the concentrations assessed in equal-volume pool as well as averaging creatinine-standardized concentrations measured in each individual spot sample are not suitable for BPA. These results provide a practical framework on how to combine repeated biospecimens in epidemiological studies.},

  abstract = {Background: In recent years the Illumina HumanMethylation450 (HM450) BeadChip has provided a user-friendly platform to profile DNA methylation in human samples. However, HM450 lacked coverage of distal regulatory elements. Illumina have now released the MethylationEPIC (EPIC) BeadChip, with new content specifically designed to target these regions. We have used HM450 and whole-genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS) to perform a critical evaluation of the new EPIC array platform. Results: EPIC covers over 850,000 CpG sites, including {$>$}90 \% of the CpGs from the HM450 and an additional 413,743 CpGs. Even though the additional probes improve the coverage of regulatory elements, including 58 \% of FANTOM5 enhancers, only 7 \% distal and 27 \% proximal ENCODE regulatory elements are represented. Detailed comparisons of regulatory elements from EPIC and WGBS show that a single EPIC probe is not always informative for those distal regulatory elements showing variable methylation across the region. However, overall data from the EPIC array at single loci are highly reproducible across technical and biological replicates and demonstrate high correlation with HM450 and WGBS data. We show that the HM450 and EPIC arrays distinguish differentially methylated probes, but the absolute agreement depends on the threshold set for each platform. Finally, we provide an annotated list of probes whose signal could be affected by cross-hybridisation or underlying genetic variation. Conclusion: The EPIC array is a significant improvement over the HM450 array, with increased genome coverage of regulatory regions and high reproducibility and reliability, providing a valuable tool for high-throughput human methylome analyses from diverse clinical samples.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genomic imprinting, mediated by parent-of-origin-specific epigenetic silencing, adjusts the gene expression dosage in mammals. We aimed to clarify parental allelic expression in the human placenta for 396 claimed candidate imprinted genes and to assess the evidence for the proposed enrichment of imprinted expression in the placenta. The study utilized RNA-Seq-based transcriptome and genotyping data from 54 parental-placental samples representing the three trimesters of gestation, and term cases of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and fetal growth disturbances. RESULTS: Almost half of the targeted genes (n = 179; 45\%) were either not transcribed or showed limited expression in the human placenta. After filtering for the presence of common exonic SNPs, adequacy of sequencing reads and informative families, 91 genes were retained (43 loci form Geneimprint database; 48 recently proposed genes). Only 11/91 genes (12.1\%) showed confident signals of imprinting (binomial test, Bonferroni corrected P {$<$} 0.05; {$>$}\,90\% transcripts originating from one parental allele). The confirmed imprinted genes exhibit enriched placental expression (PHLDA2, H19, IGF2, MEST, ZFAT, PLAGL1, AIM1) or are transcribed additionally only in the adrenal gland (MEG3, RTL1, PEG10, DLK1). Parental monoallelic expression showed extreme stability across gestation and in term pregnancy complications. A distinct group of additional 14 genes exhibited a statistically significant bias in parental allelic proportions defined as having 65-90\% of reads from one parental allele (e.g., KLHDC10, NLRP2, RHOBTB3, DNMT1). Molecular mechanisms behind biased parental expression are still to be clarified. However, 66 of 91 (72.5\%) analyzed candidate imprinted genes showed no signals of deviation from biallelic expression. CONCLUSIONS: As placental tissue is not included in The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, the study contributed to fill the gap in the knowledge concerning parental allelic expression. A catalog of parental allelic proportions and gene expression of analyzed loci across human gestation and in term pregnancy complications is provided as additional files. The study outcome suggested that true imprinting in the human placenta is restricted to well-characterized loci. High expression of imprinted genes during mid-pregnancy supports their critical role in developmental programming. Consistent with the data on other GTEx tissues, the number of human imprinted genes appears to be overestimated.},

  abstract = {Alterations in the gene expression of organs in contact with the environment may signal exposure to toxins. To identify genes in lung tissue whose expression levels are altered by cigarette smoking, we compared the transcriptomes of lung tissue between 118 ever smokers and 58 never smokers. In all cases, the tissue studied was non-involved lung tissue obtained at lobectomy from patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Of the 17,097 genes analyzed, 357 were differentially expressed between ever smokers and never smokers (FDR\,{$<$}\,0.05), including 290 genes that were up-regulated and 67 down-regulated in ever smokers. For 85 genes, the absolute value of the fold change was {$\geq$}2. The gene with the smallest FDR was MYO1A (FDR\,=\,6.9\,\texttimes\,10-4) while the gene with the largest difference between groups was FGG (fold change\,=\,31.60). Overall, 100 of the genes identified in this study (38.6\%) had previously been found to associate with smoking in at least one of four previously reported datasets of non-involved lung tissue. Seven genes (KMO, CD1A, SPINK5, TREM2, CYBB, DNASE2B, FGG) were differentially expressed between ever and never smokers in all five datasets, with concordant higher expression in ever smokers. Smoking-induced up-regulation of six of these genes was also observed in a transcription dataset from lung tissue of non-cancer patients. Among the three most significant gene networks, two are involved in immunity and inflammation and one in cell death. Overall, this study shows that the lung parenchyma transcriptome of smokers has altered gene expression and that these alterations are reproducible in different series of smokers across countries. Moreover, this study identified a seven-gene panel that reflects lung tissue exposure to cigarette smoke.},

  abstract = {More than 135 million births occur each year; yet, the molecular underpinnings of human parturition in gestational tissues, and in particular the placenta, are still poorly understood. The placenta is a complex heterogeneous organ including cells of both maternal and fetal origin, and insults that disrupt the maternal-fetal dialogue could result in adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth. There is limited knowledge of the cell type composition and transcriptional activity of the placenta and its compartments during physiologic and pathologic parturition. To fill this knowledge gap, we used scRNA-seq to profile the placental villous tree, basal plate, and chorioamniotic membranes of women with or without labor at term and those with preterm labor. Significant differences in cell type composition and transcriptional profiles were found among placental compartments and across study groups. For the first time, two cell types were identified: 1) lymphatic endothelial decidual cells in the chorioamniotic membranes, and 2) non-proliferative interstitial cytotrophoblasts in the placental villi. Maternal macrophages from the chorioamniotic membranes displayed the largest differences in gene expression (e.g. NFKB1) in both processes of labor; yet, specific gene expression changes were also detected in preterm labor. Importantly, several placental scRNA-seq transcriptional signatures were modulated with advancing gestation in the maternal circulation, and specific immune cell type signatures were increased with labor at term (NK-cell and activated T-cell signatures) and with preterm labor (macrophage, monocyte, and activated T-cell signatures). Herein, we provide a catalogue of cell types and transcriptional profiles in the human placenta, shedding light on the molecular underpinnings and non-invasive prediction of the physiologic and pathologic parturition.},

To accomplish these numerous functions, the placenta depends on a highly efficient energy metabolism control. Recent studies showed that the orphan nuclear receptor Estrogen-Related Receptor gamma (ERR{$\gamma$}) is highly expressed in human placentas. As ERR{$\gamma$} has been described as a major energy metabolism regulator, we investigated ERR{$\gamma$} expression and putative roles on energy homeostasis in human trophoblast from first trimester placentas. First, we showed that ERR{$\gamma$} expression level increased during pregnancy and that ERR{$\gamma$} was more abundant in villous than in extravillous trophoblasts. We also observed that ERR{$\gamma$} expression increased during trophoblast differentiation. Second, we demonstrated that mitochondrial biogenesis and expression of some energy metabolism target genes decreased when ERR{$\gamma$} expression was impaired. Altogether, these results suggest that ERR{$\gamma$} could be implicated in the energy metabolism regulation of human trophoblasts.},

The method consists of a rapid protein precipitation by methanol followed by high throughput online solid phase extraction (SPE), ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS), and negative electrospray ionization detection. The method was developed for simultaneous determination of twenty-five PFASs, including polyfluoroalkyl phosphate esters (PAPs; 6:2, 8:2, 6:2/6:2, and 8:2/8:2), perfluoroalkyl phosphonates (PFPAs; C6, C8, and C10), perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSAs; C4, C6, C7, C8, and C10), perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs; C5C14), and perfluoroalkyl sulfonamides (FOSAs; C8, N-methyl, and N-ethyl). High linearity of matrix-matched calibration standards (correlation coefficients, R~=~0.99-0.999) were obtained in the range of 0.006-45~ng~mL-1 blood. Excellent sensitivity was achieved with method detection limits (MDLs) between 0.0018 and 0.09~ng~mL-1, depending on the compound and matrix. The method was validated for serum, plasma, and whole blood (n~=~5~+~5) at six levels in the range 0.0180-30~ng~mL-1. The accuracy (n~=~5) was on average 102{$\pm~$}12\%. The intermediate precision (n~=~10) ranged from 2 to 40\% with an average between-batch of analyses difference of 10{$\pm~$}10\%.

The aim of this study is to understand DNA methylation patterns across different stages of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Results Our study identified 72, 93 and 170 significant DNA methylated genes in Stages I, II and III respectively. A set of common 34 significant DNA methylated genes located in the promoter section of the true CpG islands were found across stages, and these were: HOX genes, FOXG1, GRIK3, HAND2, PRKCB, etc. Of the total significant DNA methylated genes, 65 correlated with transcription function. The epigenetic analysis identified the following novel genes across all stages: PTGDR, TLX3, and POU4F2. The stage-wise analysis observed the appearance of NEUROG1 gene in Stage I and its re-appearance in Stage III. The analysis showed similar epigenetic pattern across Stage I and Stage III. Pathway analysis revealed important signaling and metabolic pathways of LUAD to correlate with epigenetics. Epigenetic subnetwork analysis identified a set of seven conserved genes across all stages: UBC, KRAS, PIK3CA, PIK3R3, RAF1, BRAF, and RAP1A. A detailed literature analysis elucidated epigenetic genes like FOXG1, HLA-G, and NKX6-2 to be known as prognostic targets. Conclusion Integrating epigenetic information for genes with expression data can be useful for comprehending in-depth disease mechanism and for the ultimate goal of better target identification.},

  abstract = {It is well known, but frequently overlooked, that low- and high-throughput molecular data may contain batch effects, i.e., systematic technical variation. Confounding of experimental batches with the variable(s) of interest is especially concerning, as a batch effect may then be interpreted as a biologically significant finding. An integral step towards reducing false discovery in molecular data analysis includes inspection for batch effects and accounting for this signal if present. In a 30-sample pilot Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 (450k array) experiment, we identified two sources of batch effects: array row and chip. Here, we demonstrate two approaches taken to process the 450k data in which an R function, ComBat, was applied to adjust for the non-biological signal. In the ``initial analysis'', the application of ComBat to an unbalanced study design resulted in 9,612 and 19,214 significant (FDR{$<$}0.05) DNA methylation differences, despite none present prior to correction. Suspicious of this dramatic change, a ``revised processing'' included changes to our analysis as well as a greater number of samples, and successfully reduced batch effects without introducing false signal. Our work supports conclusions made by an article previously published in this journal: though the ultimate antidote to batch effects is thoughtful study design, every DNA methylation microarray analysis should inspect, assess and, if necessary, account for batch effects. The analysis experience presented here can serve as a reminder to the broader community to establish research questions a priori, ensure that they match with study design and encourage communication between technicians and analysts.},

The aetiology of SRS is complex and current evidence strongly implicates imprinted genes. Approximately half of all patients exhibit DNA hypomethylation at the H19/IGF2 imprinted domain, and around 10\% have maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7. We measured DNA methylation in 18 SRS patients at {$>$}485,000 CpG sites using DNA methylation microarrays. Using a novel bioinformatics methodology specifically designed to identify subsets of patients with a shared epimutation, we analysed methylation changes genome-wide as well as at known imprinted regions to identify SRS-associated epimutations. Our analysis identifies epimutations at the previously characterised domains of H19/IGF2 and at imprinted regions on chromosome 7, providing proof of principle that our methodology can detect DNA methylation changes at imprinted loci. In addition we discovered two novel epimutations associated with SRS and located at imprinted loci previously linked to relevant mouse and human phenotypes. We identify RB1 as an additional imprinted locus associated with SRS, with a region near the RB1 DMR hypermethylated in 13/18 (\textasciitilde 70 \%) patients. We also report 6/18 (\textasciitilde 33 \%) patients were hypermethylated at a CpG island near the ANKRD11 gene. We do not observe consistent cooccurrence of epimutations at multiple imprinted loci in single SRS individuals. SRS is clinically heterogeneous and the absence of multiple imprinted loci epimutations reflects the heterogeneity at the molecular level. Further stratification of SRS patients by molecular phenotypes might aid the identification of disease causes.},

Child behavior was assessed by parent and teacher ratings on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Teacher Report Form, respectively. Results The mean(SD) total GWG(kg) was 14.5(5.9), and 10\% of women had a pregravid BMI {$\geq$}30. Pre-pregnancy obesity (BMI of 30kg/m2) was associated with increased offspring problem behaviors including internalizing behaviors (adjusted {$\beta$}: 3.3 points, 95\% CI: 1.7, 4.9), externalizing behaviors (adjusted {$\beta$}: 2.9 points, 95\% CI: 1.4, 4.6), and attention problems (adjusted {$\beta$}: 2.3 points, 95\% CI: 1.1, 3.4) on the CBCL, compared with normal weight mothers (BMI of 22 kg/m2). There were non-significant trends towards increased offspring impulsivity with low GWG among lean mothers (adjusted IRR: 1.2, 95\% CI: 0.9, 1.5) and high GWG among overweight mothers (adjusted IRR: 1.7, 95\% CI: 0.9, 2.8), but additional outcomes did not differ by GWG z-score. Results were not meaningful different after excluding high-substance users. Conclusions In a low-income and high-risk sample, we observed a small increase in child behavior problems among children of obese mothers, which could have an impact on child behavior in the population.},

  abstract = {Pseudohypoparathyroid patients have resistance predominantly to parathyroid hormone (PTH), and here we have examined the ability of an alternative G{$\alpha$}s-related protein to inhibit G{$\alpha$}s activity in a hormone-selective manner. We tested whether the G/VAS exon A/B-derived NH2-terminally truncated (Tr) {$\alpha$}s protein alters stimulation of adenylate cyclase by the PTH receptor (PTHR1), the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor (TSHR), the {$\beta$}2-adrenergic receptor ({$\beta$}2AR), or the AVP receptor (V2R). HEK293 cells cotransfected with receptor and full-length (FL) G{$\alpha$}s{$\pm$}Tr {$\pm$}s protein expression vectors were stimulated with agonists (PTH [10-7 to 10-9 M], TSH [1 to 100 mU], isoproterenol [10-6 to 10-8M], or AVP [10-6 to 10-8M]). Following PTH stimulation, HEK293 cells cotransfected with PTHR1 + FL G{$\alpha$}s + Tr {$\alpha$}s had a significantly lower cAMP response than those transfected with only PTHR1 + FL G{$\alpha$}s. Tr {$\alpha$}s also exerted an inhibitory effect on the cAMP levels stimulated by TSH via the TSHR but had little or no effect on isoproterenol or AVP acting via {$\beta$}2AR or V2R, respectively. These differences mimic the spectrum of hormone resistance in pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a (PHP-1a) and type 1b (PHP-1b) patients. In opossum kidney (OK) cells, endogenously expressing the PTHR1 and {$\beta$}2AR, the exogenous expression of Tr {$\alpha$}s at a level similar to endogenous FL G{$\alpha$}s resulted in blunting of the cAMP response to PTH, whereas that to isoproterenol was unaltered. A pseudopseudohypoparathyroid patient with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy harbored a de novo paternally inherited M1l G{$\alpha$}s mutation. Similar maternally inherited mutations at the initiation codon have been identified previously in PHP-1a patients. The M1l {$\alpha$}s mutant (lacking the first 59 amino acids of G{$\alpha$}s) blunted the increase in cAMP levels stimulated via the PTHR1 in both HEK293 and OK cells similar to the Tr {$\alpha$}s protein. Thus NH2-terminally truncated forms of G{$\alpha$}s may contribute to the pathogenesis of pseudohypoparathyroidism by inhibiting the activity of G{$\alpha$}s itself in a GPCR selective manner.},

  abstract = {, Triclosan (TCS) and triclocarban (TCC) are antimicrobial agents formulated in a wide variety of consumer products (including soaps, toothpaste, medical devices, plastics, and fabrics) that are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In late 2014, the FDA will consider regulating the use of both chemicals, which are under scrutiny regarding lack of effectiveness, potential for endocrine disruption, and potential contribution to bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Here, we report on body burdens of TCS and TCC resulting from real-world exposures during pregnancy. Using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we determined the concentrations of TCS, TCC, and its human metabolites (2{${'}$}-hydroxy-TCC and 3{${'}$}-hydroxy-TCC) as well as the manufacturing byproduct (3{${'}$}-chloro-TCC) as total concentrations ({$\Sigma-$}) after conjugate hydrolysis in maternal urine and cord blood plasma from a cohort of 181 expecting mother/infant pairs in an urban multiethnic population from Brooklyn, NY recruited in 2007\textendash 09. TCS was detected in 100\% of urine and 51\% of cord blood samples after conjugate hydrolysis. The interquartile range (IQR) of detected TCS concentrations in urine was highly similar to the IQR reported previously for the age-matched population of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2003 to 2004, but typically higher than the IQR reported previously for the general population (detection frequency = 74.6\%). Urinary levels of TCC are reported here for the first time from real-world exposures during pregnancy, showing a median concentration of 0.21 {$\mu$}g/L. Urinary concentrations of TCC correlated well with its phase-I metabolite {$\sum$}-2{${'}$}-hydroxy-TCC (r = 0.49) and the manufacturing byproduct {$\sum$}-3{${'}$}-chloro-TCC C (r = 0.79), and {$\sum$}-2{${'}$}-hydroxy-TCC correlated strongly with {$\sum$}-3{${'}$}-hydroxy-TCC (r = 0.99). This human biomonitoring study presents the first body burden data for TCC from exposures occurring during pregnancy and provides additional data on composite exposure to TCS (i.e., from both consumer-product use and environmental sources) in the maternal\textendash fetal unit for an urban population in the United States.},

Fetal and neonatal periods are particularly susceptible to endocrine disorders which prenatal exposure to phthalates cause. There is increasing evidence concerning the potential endocrine-disrupting for phthalates exposure during pregnancy. This article aims to review the endocrine impairment and potential outcomes of prenatal phthalates exposure. Prenatal exposure phthalates give rise to the alterations of thyroid and sex hormone levels in pregnant women and offspring and the disruption of circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in mother, which result in adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes such as preterm birth, preeclampsia, glucose disorders in mother and cryptorchidism, hypospadias, as well as shorter anogenital distance in newborns, and growth restriction not only in infants but also in early adolescence and childhood. The relationship of prenatal phthalate exposure with maternal and neonatal outcomes in human beings was often sex-specific associations. Due to the potentially harmful influence of prenatal phthalates exposure, steps should be taken to prevent or reduce phthalate exposure during pregnancy.},

  abstract = {Background: In recent years, prevalence rates of behavioral disorders in children have increased. One factor possibly implied in the etiology of behavioral disorders is exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). The use of PFASs is highly integrated into everyday life, and exposure is ubiquitous. Exposure to PFASs during early life may be particularly harmful, as it represents a critical time window for brain development. However, research in the area is limited, especially among preschool children. The objective of the current study was to explore the relationship between prenatal exposure to several PFASs and behavioral development at the age of 18 months. Methods: Data from the Dutch cohort LINC (Linking Maternal Nutrition to Child Health) were used. Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were measured in cord plasma. The total exposure of PFASs was also calculated ({$\Sigma$}PFASs). Behavioral development was assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist 1.5\textendash 5 (CBCL 1.5\textendash 5). The CBCL scales ``Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder'' (ADHD) and ``Externalizing problems'' were used for further analysis. Separate regression models were composed for each combination, in which exposure levels were classified in tertiles. Both whole population and sex-stratified analyses were performed. A family history of ADHD, the educational level, smoking or using alcohol or illicit drugs during pregnancy were considered as confounders. In total, data from 76 mother-child pairs was included. Results: No significant associations were found between prenatal PFAS exposure and ADHD scores in the whole population and in the sex-stratified analyses. With regard to externalizing behavior, a significant negative association was found between the highest levels of {$\Sigma$}PFAS exposure and externalizing problem behavior in the whole population, but only in the crude model. After stratifying for sex, boys in the second and third tertile of exposure to PFOA presented significantly lower scores on the Externalizing Problem Scale than boys with the lowest exposure levels in the adjusted model. Girls exposed to higher levels of {$\Sigma$}PFAS exposure (T2) showed significantly lower scores on the Externalizing Problem Scale, in both crude and adjusted models. No significant associations with PFOS were found. Conclusions: Results from the current study show that prenatal exposure to PFOA was negatively related to externalizing behavior in boys. Results were different for boys and girls, emphasizing that mechanisms at work might be sex-dependent. However, results should be interpreted with caution as the sample size was small.},

  abstract = {The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of maternal oral exposure to the antibacterial Triclosan (TCS) during gestation and lactation on the metabolic status of the adult offspring and on the expression of main genes controlling the appetite regulatory network. Pregnant rats were fed ad-libitum with ground food + TCS (1 mg/kg) from day 14 of gestation to day 20 of lactation (n=3) or ground food (n=3). After litter reduction, 12 males and 12 females born from the TCS exposed rats (TCS, n=24) or not (Control, n=24) were used to evaluate monthly body weight, food intake, plasma levels of cholesterol, glucose and triglycerides, and the hypothalamic mRNA expression of agouti-related protein (Agrp), neuropeptide Y (Npy) and propiomelanocortin (Pomc). Body weight for rats in the TCS group was 12.5\% heavier for males at 4 months (p{$<$}0.001) and 19\% heavier for females at 8 months (p=0.01). Food intake was significantly higher for rats in the TCS group at 5 months of age (p{$<$}0.01). Cholesterol and glucose levels were significantly higher for rats in the TCS group at 8 months (p{$<$}0.05). mRNA expression of Npy and Agrp were significantly increased in hypothalami of rats in the TCS group at 2 months for males or 8 months for females (p{$<$}0.05). In conclusion, low doses of oral TCS consumption by the pregnant and lactating dam increase the hypothalamic expression of the orexigenic neuropeptides Npy and Agrp in the offspring and alter their metabolic status during adulthood, resembling development of the metabolic syndrome.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The function of Kv4.3 (KCND3) channels, which underlie the transient outward current I(to) in human heart, can be modulated by several accessory subunits such as KChIP2 and KCNE1-KCNE5. Here we aimed to determine the regional expression of Kv4.3, KChIP2, and KCNE mRNAs in non-failing and failing human hearts and to investigate the functional consequences of subunit coexpression in heterologous expression systems. METHODS: We quantified mRNA levels for two Kv4.3 isoforms, Kv4.3-S and Kv4.3-L, and for KChIP2 as well as KCNE1-KCNE5 with real-time RT-PCR. We also studied the effects of KCNEs on Kv4.3+KChIP2 current characteristics in CHO cells with the whole-cell voltage-clamp method. RESULTS: In non-failing hearts, low expression was found for KCNE1, KCNE3, and KCNE5, three times higher expression for KCNE2, and 60 times higher for KCNE4. Transmural gradients were detected only for KChIP2 in left and right ventricles. Compared to non-failing tissue, failing hearts showed higher expression of Kv4.3-L and KCNE1 and lower of Kv4.3-S, KChIP2, KCNE4, and KCNE5. In CHO cells, Kv4.3+KChIP2 currents were differentially modified by co-expressed KCNEs: time constants of inactivation were shorter with KCNE1 and KCNE3-5 while time-to-peak was decreased, and V(0.5) of steady-state inactivation was shifted to more negative potentials by all KCNE subunits. Importantly, KCNE2 induced a unique and prominent 'overshoot' of peak current during recovery from inactivation similar to that described for human I(to) while other KCNE subunits induced little (KCNE4,5) or no overshoot. CONCLUSIONS: All KCNEs are expressed in the human heart at the transcript level. Compared to I(to) in native human myocytes, none of the combination of KChIP2 and KCNE produced an ideal congruency in current characteristics, suggesting that additional factors contribute to the regulation of the native I(to) channel.},

Like Kaiser's rule, this test is one of the most frequently used strategies for determining the number of components to retain. However, the graphical nature of the scree test does not definitively establish the number of components to retain. To circumvent this issue, some numerical solutions are proposed, one in the spirit of Cattell's work and dealing with the scree part of the eigenvalues plot, and one focusing on the elbow part of this plot. A simulation study compares the efficiency of these solutions to those of other previously proposed methods. Extensions to factor analysis are possible and may be particularly useful with many low-dimensional components.},

Recent advances in genomic technologies have placed us in a position to initiate large-scale studies of human disease-associated epigenetic variation, specifically variation in DNA methylation (DNAm). Such Epigenome-Wide Association Studies (EWAS) present novel opportunities but also create new challenges that are not encountered in GWAS. We discuss EWAS study design, cohort and sample selections, statistical significance and power, confounding factors, and follow-up studies. We also discuss how integration of EWAS with GWAS can help to dissect complex GWAS haplotypes for functional analysis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mercury is a ubiquitous heavy metal that may negatively affect human health. It is desirable to investigate mercury exposure in vulnerable populations. OBJECTIVE: To determine the concentrations of total mercury (T-Hg) in cord blood and to evaluate the role of maternal fish consumption in a Spanish mother and child cohort. METHODS: A total of 1883 mother and child pairs from a population-based cohort were included between 2004 and 2008. T-Hg concentrations were measured in whole cord blood and maternal seafood consumption was ascertained by means of a food-frequency questionnaire. Linear regression was used in stratified analyses, while a joint model was adjusted using a mixed-effects linear model. RESULTS: Maternal daily seafood consumption was 78g/d and the geometric mean for T-Hg was 8.2{$\mu$}g/L. Maternal fish intake during pregnancy, mother's age, country of origin, educational level, employment status and parity, as well as area of study and season of delivery, were associated with cord blood T-Hg levels. A doubling in consumption of large oily fish was associated with an increase of 11.4\% (95\%CI: 3.8 to 19.6\%) in cord blood T-Hg levels, followed by an increase of 8.4\% (95\%CI: 5.7 to 11.2\%) in the case of canned tuna and 8.3\% (95\%CI: 5.5 to 11.1\%) in that of lean fish. CONCLUSION: A high proportion of newborns had elevated concentrations of cord blood T-Hg according to the current US-EPA reference dose (5.8{$\mu$}g/L for methylmercury). Mercury concentrations were related to maternal fish consumption, with large oily fish being the main contributor.},

Methods\textemdash We open with a discussion of children's vulnerability to neurotoxic substances, changes in the distribution of toxic exposures, and co-occurrence of social and physical exposures. We address trends in prevalence of mental health disorders, and approaches to the definition of disorders that are sensitive to the subtle effects of toxic exposures. We suggest broadening outcomes to include dimensional measures of autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and child learning capacity, as well as direct assessment of brain function. Findings\textemdash We consider the impact of two important exposures on children's mental health: lead and pesticides. We argue that longitudinal research designs may capture the cascading effects of exposures across biological systems and the full-range of neuropsychological endpoints. Neuroimaging is a valuable tool for observing brain maturation under varying environmental conditions. A dimensional approach to measurement may be sensitive to subtle sub-clinical toxic effects, permitting the development of exposure-related profiles and testing of complex functional relationships between brain and behavior. Questions about the neurotoxic effects of chemicals become more pressing when viewed through the lens of environmental justice. Conclusions\textemdash Reduction in the burden of child mental health disorders will require longitudinal study of neurotoxic exposures, incorporating dimensional approaches to outcome assessment and measures of brain function. Research that seeks to identify links between toxic exposures and mental health outcomes has enormous public health and societal value.},

Of the 156 pregnant women, chronic pain conditions were reported by 44 (28.2\%). The most common chronic pain complaints included neck and/or back pain (34.1\%) and headaches (31.8\%). Of subjects with chronic pain, 95.5\% were taking at least one prescription medication (mean\,=\,2.6\,{$\pm$}\,2.1, range of 0\textendash 10). Acetaminophen (43.2\%) and opioids (43.2\%) were the most common.

No association was found between congenital abnormalities and duration of use during the first trimester. Increased prevalence was not observed for specific abnormalities, except for ``medial cysts, fistula, sinus'' (congenital abnormalities of the ear, face, and neck, ICD-10 code Q18.8, n = 43) with an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.15 (1.17-3.95).

Methods To examine whether prenatal exposure to acetaminophen reduces the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, we used data from the Danish National Birth Cohort. We also examined the combined potential effects of acetaminophen, coffee and tobacco use on preeclampsia and preterm birth. The study population consisted of women who provided information on acetaminophen use during pregnancy and gave birth to singletons (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 98 140). The cohort was linked to the Danish National Hospital Registry and the Medical Birth Registry, which covers all Danish hospitals, miscarriages and births in Denmark. Results Women using acetaminophen during the third trimester of pregnancy had an increased risk of preterm birth [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1.14, 95\% CI: 1.03\textendash 1.26]. The risk of preterm birth was increased in mothers with pre-eclampsia (HR {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1.55, 95\% CI: 1.16\textendash 2.07) but not in women without pre-eclampsia (HR {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1.08, 95\% CI: 0.97\textendash 1.20). Tobacco smoking and coffee consumption did not modify the effect of acetaminophen in any consistent pattern. No association was found between acetaminophen use and risk of preterm complications, miscarriages, stillbirths, low birth weight or small size for gestational age. Conclusion Findings do not provide strong support for a change in clinical practice regarding use of acetaminophen during pregnancy, but the increased risk of preterm birth among women with preeclampsia should be further investigated.},

  abstract = {Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. It is known that GDM is associated with an altered placental function and changes in placental gene regulation. More recent studies demonstrated an involvement of epigenetic mechanisms. So far, the focus regarding placental epigenetic changes in GDM was set on gene-specific DNA methylation analyses. Studies that robustly investigated placental global DNA methylation are lacking. However, several studies showed that tissue-specific alterations in global DNA methylation are independently associated with type 2 diabetes. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize global placental DNA methylation by robustly measuring placental DNA 5-methylcytosine (5mC) content and to examine whether differences in placental global DNA methylation are associated with GDM. Methods: Global DNA methylation was quantified by the current gold standard method, LC-MS/MS. In total, 1030 placental samples were analyzed in this single-center birth cohort study. Results: Mothers with GDM displayed a significantly increased global placental DNA methylation (3.22 {$\pm$} 0.63 vs. 3.00 {$\pm$} 0.46 \%; p = 0.013; {$\pm$}SD). Bivariate logistic regression showed a highly significant positive correlation between global placental DNA methylation and the presence of GDM (p = 0.0009). Quintile stratification according to placental DNA 5mC levels revealed that the frequency of GDM was evenly distributed in quintiles 1\textendash 4 (2.9\textendash 5.3 \%), whereas the frequency in the fifth quintile was significantly higher (10.7 \%; p = 0.003). Bivariate logistic models adjusted for maternal age, BMI, ethnicity, recurrent miscarriages, and familiar diabetes predisposition clearly demonstrated an independent association between global placental DNA hypermethylation and GDM. Furthermore, an ANCOVA model considering known predictors of DNA methylation substantiated an independent association between GDM and placental DNA methylation. Conclusions: This is the first study that employed a robust quantitative assessment of placental global DNA methylation in over a thousand placental samples. The study provides large scale evidence that placental global DNA hypermethylation is associated with GDM, independent of established risk factors.},

Utilizing mass spectrometry and biochemistry approaches we identified the Zn-finger protein ZNF326, as a novel interaction partner and substrate of the nuclear PRMT5/WDR77 complex. ZNF326 is symmetrically dimethylated at arginine 175 (R175) and this modification is lost in a PRMT5 and WDR77-dependent manner. Loss of PRMT5 or WDR77 in MDA-MB-231 cells leads to defects in alternative splicing, including inclusion of A-T rich exons in target genes, a phenomenon that has previously been observed upon loss of ZNF326. We observed that the alternatively spliced transcripts of a subset of these genes, involved in proliferation and tumor cell migration like REPIN1/AP4, ST3GAL6, TRNAU1AP and PFKM are degraded upon loss of PRMT5. In summary, we have identified a novel mechanism through which the PRMT5/WDR77 complex maintains the balance between splicing and mRNA stability through methylation of ZNF326.},

METHODS: PBMCs were isolated from whole blood of 50 SSc patients and 30 controls. After the extraction of total RNA and DNA contents from PBMCs, complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized. Afterwards, quantitative analysis of IRF7 messenger RNA (mRNA) was conducted by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To evaluate the methylation status of the promoter region of IRF7 gene, PCR products of bisulfite-treated DNA from SSc patients and controls were sequenced. RESULTS: The mRNA expression of IRF7 in PBMCs from patients compared with controls was significantly upregulated. While limited cutaneous SSc patients expressed the mRNA of IRF7 higher than controls, the diffuse cutaneous SSc group did not demonstrate significantly increased expression in comparison to controls. Insignificant promoter hypomethylation of IRF7 was observed in SSc patients compared with the control group. However, CpG2 hypomethylation was significantly associated with increased SSc risk. Furthermore, overall promoter methylation and mRNA level of IRF7 were significantly correlated with each other. Nonetheless, none of them correlated with Rodnan score of SSc patients. There was significant difference in IRF7 mRNA expression between CpG8 methylated and unmethylated SSc patients. Moreover, the difference of methylation and expression was not significant between anti-nuclear antibody (ANA)-positive and ANA-negative SSc patients. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that hypomethylation of the IRF7 promoter might play a role in SSc pathogenesis, probably through promoting the IRF7 expression in PBMCs of patients with SSc.},

  abstract = {Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) is caused by reduced expression of genes within the GNAS cluster, resulting in parathormone resistance. The cluster contains multiple imprinted transcripts, including the stimulatory G protein {$\alpha$} subunit (Gs-{$\alpha$}) and NESP55 transcript preferentially expressed from the maternal allele, and the paternally expressed XLas, A/B and antisense transcripts. PHP1b can be caused by loss of imprinting affecting GNAS A/B alone (associated with STX16 deletion), or the entire GNAS cluster (associated with deletions of NESP55 in a minority of cases). We performed targeted genomic next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the GNAS cluster to seek variants and indels underlying PHP1b. Seven patients were sequenced by hybridisation-based capture and fourteen more by long-range PCR and transposon-mediated insertion and sequencing. A bioinformatic pipeline was developed for variant and indel detection. In one family with two affected siblings, and in a second family with a single affected individual, we detected maternally inherited deletions of 40 and 33\,bp, respectively, within the deletion previously reported in rare families with PHP1b. All three affected individuals presented with atypically severe PHP1b; interestingly, the unaffected mother in one family had the detected deletion on her maternally inherited allele. Targeted NGS can reveal sequence changes undetectable by current diagnostic methods. Identification of genetic mutations underlying epigenetic changes can facilitate accurate diagnosis and counselling, and potentially highlight genetic elements critical for normal imprint setting.},

  abstract = {p,p'-DDT (bis[p-chlorophenyl]-1,1,1-trichloroethane) is a persistent organochlorine compound that has been used worldwide as an insecticide. The authors evaluated the association of cord serum levels of DDT and its metabolite, 2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethylene (DDE), with neurodevelopment at age 4 years. Two birth cohorts in Ribera d'Ebre and Menorca (Spain) were recruited between 1997 and 1999 (n = 475). Infants were assessed at age 4 years by using the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities. Organochlorine compounds were measured in cord serum. Children's diet and parental sociodemographic information was obtained through questionnaire. Results showed that DDT cord serum concentration at birth was inversely associated with verbal, memory, quantitative, and perceptual-performance skills at age 4 years. Children whose DDT concentrations in cord serum were {$>$}0.20 ng/ml had mean decreases of 7.86 (standard error, 3.21) points in the verbal scale and 10.86 (standard error, 4.33) points in the memory scale when compared with children whose concentrations were {$<$}0.05 ng/ml. These associations were stronger among girls. Prenatal exposure to background, low-level concentrations of DDT was associated with a decrease in preschoolers' cognitive skills. These results should be considered when evaluating the risk and benefits of spraying DDT during antimalaria and other disease-vector campaigns.},

  abstract = {Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are exogenous chemicals that may occur naturally (e.g., phytoestrogens), while others are industrial substances and plasticizers commonly utilized worldwide to which human exposure, particularly at low-doses, is omnipresent, persistent and occurs in complex mixtures. EDCs can interfere with/or mimic estrogenic hormones and, consequently, can simultaneously trigger diverse signaling pathways which result in diverse and divergent biological responses. Additionally, EDCs can also bioaccumulate in lipid compartments of the organism forming a mixed ``body burden'' of contaminants. Although the independent action of chemicals has been considered the main principle in EDCs mixture toxicity, recent studies have demonstrated that numerous effects cannot be predicted when analyzing single compounds independently. Co-exposure to these agents, particularly in critical windows of exposure, may induce hazardous health effects potentially associated with a complex ``body burden'' of different origins. Here, we performed an exhaustive review of the available literature regarding EDCs mixtures exposure, toxicity mechanisms and effects, particularly at the most vulnerable human life stages. Although the assessment of potential risks to human health due to exposure to EDCs mixtures is a major topic for consumer safety, information regarding effective mixtures effects is still scarce.},

Recent studies have suggested that mutations on the paternal, but not the maternal, GNAS allele could be associated with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and thus small size for gestational age. Objectives: The aim of the study was to confirm and expand these findings in a large number of patients presenting with either PHP-Ia or PPHP/POH. Patients and Methods: We collected birth parameters (ie, gestational age, weight, length, and head circumference) of patients with either PHP-Ia (n = 29) or PPHP/POH (n = 26) with verified GNAS mutations. The parental allele carrying the mutation was assessed by investigating the parents or, when a de novo mutation was identified, through informative intragenic polymorphisms. Results: Heterozygous GNAS mutations on either parental allele were associated with IUGR. However, when these mutations are located on the paternal GNAS allele, IUGR was considerably more pronounced than with mutations on the maternal allele. Moreover, birth weights were lower with paternal GNAS mutations affecting exons 2\textendash 13 than with exon 1/intron 1 mutations. Conclusions: These data indicate that a paternally derived GNAS transcript, possibly XL{$\alpha$}s, is required for normal fetal growth and development and that this transcript affects placental functions. Thus, similar to other imprinted genes, GNAS controls growth and/or fetal development.},

OBJECTIVES: Examine associations of acetaminophen and ibuprofen use during pregnancy and infancy with executive function and behaviour problems in children. METHODS: We included 1225 mother-child pairs from Project Viva, a pre-birth cohort study. We assessed prenatal acetaminophen and ibuprofen use in early and mid-pregnancy and infant use in the first year of life using questionnaires. Parents and classroom teachers assessed child behaviours in mid-childhood (median 8~years), using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), with higher scores indicating worse functioning for both. We examined associations of acetaminophen and ibuprofen use during pregnancy and infancy with mid-childhood neurobehavioural outcomes using linear regression models adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: During pregnancy, 46.1\% of mothers used acetaminophen {$\geq$}10 times and 18.4\% used any ibuprofen. In the first year, 65.3\% and 39.6\% of infants received acetaminophen and ibuprofen {$\geq$}6 times, respectively. Higher ({$\geq$}10 vs {$<$}10 times) prenatal acetaminophen ({$\beta$} 1.64 points; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.59, 2.68) and any ibuprofen ({$\beta$} 1.56, 95\% CI 0.19, 2.92) were associated with higher parent-rated BRIEF global scores. Patterns of association were linear across categories and were similar for other parent- and teacher-rated outcomes. Infancy exposure ({$\geq$}6 vs {$<$}6 times) to acetaminophen ({$\beta$} 1.69, 95\% CI 0.51, 2.87) and ibuprofen ({$\beta$} 1.40, 95\% CI 0.25, 2.55) were associated with higher parent-rated BRIEF GEC scores but associations with teacher-rated scores were weaker. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal and early-life exposure to acetaminophen and ibuprofen were associated with poorer executive function and behaviour in childhood. These findings highlight the need for further research on the mechanisms through which analgesics may act on fetal and child brain development.},

In animals and humans, this exposure during critical developmental windows has been associated with various developmental abnormalities, including the emergence of psychiatric disorders.

Methods: We performed a systematic review with key words referring to the fields of neurodevelopment and endocrine disruptors. We reviewed 896 titles, choosing studies on the basis of titles and abstracts. We searched through the methodology sections to find perinatal exposure and neurodevelopmental disorders, following the categories indicated in the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders (5th edition). References in some studies brought us to a total of 47 studies included here. Results: Convergent studies report an association between exposure to endocrine disruptors and autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, global developmental delay, intellectual disability, communication disorders and unspecified neurodevelopmental disorders. Conclusion: Sufficient data exist to report that exposure to some endocrine disruptors is a risk factor for the emergence of neurodevelopmental disorders. Studying endocrine disruptor exposure in humans is still associated with some limits that are difficult to overcome.},

It provides a framework to advance the environmental epidemiology field that has until now focused almost exclusively on single-exposure health effects. The exposome includes an external domain, measured by methods including geo-spatial modelling, questionnaire and biomonitoring of external exposures while the internal domain is commonly assessed through molecular omics platforms. The internal domain, in part, reflects the biological response to the external domain. New statistical frameworks are required to integrate and assess exposome-health effects. The pregnancy period is a key starting point to describe the dynamic exposome, due to its heightened sensitivity and potential lifetime impact. A handful of studies have started to move towards an exposome approach in assessing the effects of the multiple exposures during pregnancy on child development. New research projects are underway to test the exposome approach on a large scale.},

Pair-wise Pearson's and polychoric correlations were calculated and principal components were derived. The median absolute correlation across all exposures was 0.06 (5th-95th centiles, 0.01-0.54). There were strong levels of correlation within families of exposure (median = 0.45, 5th-95th centiles, 0.07-0.85). Nine exposures (11\%) had a correlation higher than 0.5 with at least one exposure outside their exposure family. Effectively all the variance in the data set (99.5\%) was explained by 40 principal components. Future exposome studies should interpret exposure effects in light of their correlations to other exposures. The weak to moderate correlation observed between exposure families will permit adjustment for confounding in future exposome studies.},

Until recently, there were relatively few epidemiological studies examining the relationship between BPA and health effects in humans. However, in the last year, the number of these studies has more than doubled. A comprehensive literature search found 91 studies linking BPA to human health; 53 published within the last year. This review outlines this body of literature, showing associations between BPA exposure and adverse perinatal, childhood, and adult health outcomes, including reproductive and developmental effects, metabolic disease, and other health effects. These studies encompass both prenatal and postnatal exposures, and include several study designs and population types. While it is difficult to make causal links with epidemiological studies, the growing human literature correlating environmental BPA exposure to adverse effects in humans, along with laboratory studies in many species including primates, provides increasing support that environmental BPA exposure can be harmful to humans, especially in regards to behavioral and other effects in children.},

  abstract = {Background Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has increased in prevalence in the past decade. Studies attempting to identify a specific genetic component have not been able to account for much of the heritability of ADHD, indicating there may be gene-environment interactions underlying the disorder, including early exposure to environmental chemicals. Based on several relevant studies, we chose to examine bisphenol A (BPA) as a possible contributor to ADHD in humans. BPA is a widespread environmental chemical that has been shown to disrupt neurodevelopment in rodents and humans. Objectives Using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) framework, a systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to determine the relationship between early life exposure to BPA and hyperactivity, a key diagnostic criterion of ADHD. Data sources Searches of PubMed, Web of Science, and Toxline were completed for all literature to January 1, 2017. Study eligibility criteria For inclusion, the studies had to publish original data, be in the English language, include a measure of BPA exposure, and assess if BPA exposure affected hyperactive behaviors in mice, rats or humans. Exposure to BPA had to occur at {$<$}3 months of age for humans, up to postnatal day 35 for rats and up to postnatal day 40 for mice. Exposure could occur either gestationally (via maternal exposure) or directly to the offspring. Study appraisal and synthesis methods Studies were evaluated using the OHAT risk of bias tool. The effects in humans were assessed qualitatively. For rodents exposed to 20 {$\mu$}g/kg/day BPA, we evaluated the study findings in a random effects meta-analytical model. Results A review of the literature identified 29 rodent and 3 human studies. A random effects meta-analysis showed significantly increased hyperactivity in male rodents. In humans, early BPA exposure was associated with hyperactivity in boys and girls. Limitations, conclusions, and implications of key findings We concluded that early life BPA exposure is a presumed human hazard for the development of hyperactivity. Possible limitations of this systematic review include deficiencies in author reporting, exclusion of some literature based on language, and insufficient similarity between human studies. SRs that result in hazard-based conclusions are the first step in assessing and mitigating risks. Given the widespread exposure of BPA and increasing diagnoses of ADHD, we recommend immediate actions to complete such risk analyses and take next steps for the protection of human health. In the meantime, precautionary measures should be taken to reduce exposure in pregnant women, infants and children. The present analysis also discusses potential mechanisms by which BPA affects hyperactivity, and the most effective avenues for future research. Systematic review registration number Not available.},

  abstract = {Background Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) is caused by (epi)genetic defects in the imprinted GNAS cluster. Current classification of PHP patients is hampered by clinical and molecular diagnostic overlaps. The European Consortium for the study of PHP designed a genome-wide methylation study to improve molecular diagnosis. Methods The HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip was used to analyze genome-wide methylation in 24 PHP patients with parathyroid hormone resistance and 20 age- and gender-matched controls. Patients were previously diagnosed with GNAS-specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and include 6 patients with known STX16 deletion (PHP{$\Delta$}stx16) and 18 without deletion (PHPneg). Results The array demonstrated that PHP patients do not show DNA methylation differences at the whole-genome level. Unsupervised clustering of GNAS-specific DMRs divides PHP{$\Delta$}stx16 versus PHPneg patients. Interestingly, in contrast to the notion that all PHP patients share methylation defects in the A/B DMR while only PHP{$\Delta$}stx16 patients have normal NESP, GNAS-AS1 and XL methylation, we found a novel DMR (named GNAS-AS2) in the GNAS-AS1 region that is significantly different in both PHP{$\Delta$}stx16 and PHPneg, as validated by Sequenom EpiTYPER in a larger PHP cohort. The analysis of 58 DMRs revealed that 8/18 PHPneg and 1/6 PHP{$\Delta$}stx16 patients have multi-locus methylation defects. Validation was performed for FANCC and SVOPL DMRs. Conclusions This is the first genome-wide methylation study for PHP patients that confirmed that GNAS is the most significant DMR, and the presence of STX16 deletion divides PHP patients in two groups. Moreover, a novel GNAS-AS2 DMR affects all PHP patients, and PHP patients seem sensitive to multi-locus methylation defects.

There is epidemiological evidence for an association between prenatal exposure to EDCs and cryptorchidism, hypospadias, and decreased anogenital distance, as well as an association between an exposure to EDCs in adulthood and semen quality. However, some of these findings are inconsistent across studies. There is less evidence about the role of prenatal exposure to EDCs for semen quality, and only few studies have investigated the role of prenatal EDC exposure in testicular cancer occurrence. This is due to a lack of long-term follow-up studies linking prenatal exposures with male reproductive disorders in adulthood. More research is needed investigating the role of EDC exposure for male reproductive health, particularly long-term follow-up studies to assess the outcomes in adulthood.},

  abstract = {Background Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), which refers to reduced fetal growth in the context of placental insufficiency, is etiologically heterogeneous. IUGR is associated not only with perinatal morbidity and mortality but also with adult-onset disorders, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, posing a major health burden. Placental epigenetic dysregulation has been proposed as one mechanism that causes IUGR; however, the spectrum of epigenetic pathophysiological mechanisms leading to IUGR remains to be elucidated. Monozygotic monochorionic twins are particularly affected by IUGR, in the setting of severe discordant growth. Because monozygotic twins have the same genotype at conception and a shared maternal environment, they provide an ideal model system for studying epigenetic dysregulation of the placenta. Results We compared genome-wide placental DNA methylation patterns of severely growth-discordant twins to identify novel candidate genes for IUGR. Snap-frozen placental samples for eight severely growth-discordant monozygotic monochorionic twin pairs were obtained at delivery from each twin. A high-resolution DNA methylation array platform was used to identify methylation differences between IUGR and normal twins. Our analysis revealed differentially methylated regions in the promoters of eight genes: DECR1, ZNF300, DNAJA4, CCL28, LEPR, HSPA1A/L, GSTO1, and GNE. The largest methylation differences between the two groups were in the promoters of DECR1 and ZNF300. The significance of these group differences was independently validated by bisulfite pyrosequencing, implicating aberrations in fatty acid beta oxidation and transcriptional regulation, respectively. Further analysis of the array data identified methylation changes most prominently affecting the Wnt and cadherin pathways in the IUGR cohort. Conclusions Our results suggest that IUGR in monozygotic twins is associated with impairments in lipid metabolism and transcriptional regulation as well as cadherin and Wnt signaling. We show that monozygotic monochorionic twins discordant for growth provide a useful model to study one type of the epigenetic placental dysregulation that drives IUGR.

High concentrations of EDCs are found in several everyday products including plastic bottles and food containers and they could be easily absorbed by dietary intake. In recent years, considerable interest has been raised regarding the biological effects of EDCs, particularly Bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates, on human pregnancy and fetal development. Several evidence obtained on in vitro and animal models as well as by epidemiologic and population studies strongly indicated that endocrine disruptors could negatively impact fetal and placental health by interfering with the embryonic developing epigenome, thus establishing disease paths into adulthood. Moreover, EDCs could cause and/or contribute to the onset of severe gestational conditions as Preeclampsia (PE), Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR) and gestational diabetes in pregnancy, as well as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular complications in reproductive age. Therefore, despite contrasting data being present in the literature, endocrine disruptors must be considered as a therapeutic target. Future actions aimed at reducing or eliminating EDC exposure during the perinatal period are mandatory to guarantee pregnancy success and preserve fetal and adult health.},

Limited biomonitoring data are available in France since the implementation of these regulations, and exposure data on infants is scarce worldwide. Understanding the predictors of phenol urinary concentrations will help identify potential targets for prevention. AIM: We described levels, variability and predictors of exposure to 12 phenols in pregnant women and infants recruited between 2014 and 2017 in a French couple-child cohort. METHODS: Among 479 pregnant women and 150 of their infants, we studied phenol urinary concentrations in within-subject, within-period pools of repeated urine samples collected during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (up to 42 samples per woman), at 2~months and 12~months (up to 14 samples per infant). Time trends and associations with demographic, protocol, occupational and behavioral factors were studied using interval censored models to accommodate for undetected and unquantified urine concentrations. RESULTS: Detection rates were above 90\% for bisphenol A, ethylparaben, methylparaben, benzophenone-3 and triclosan and below 5\% for bisphenol AF, B, F and triclocarban. Median levels of bisphenol A, bisphenol S, methylparaben, ethylparaben and propylparaben at 12~months were similar or higher than during pregnancy. For pregnant women all phenols but benzophenone-3 and bisphenol S showed a linear decrease between 2014 and 2017 (p-values~{$<~$}0.02). Women with the shortest education (primary and secondary school) had higher urinary concentrations of triclosan ({$\beta~$}=~0.58 (95\% confidence interval (CI), -0.04; 1.20)), ethyl ({$\beta~$}=~0.43 (95\%CI, 0.03; 0.84)) and propyl paraben ({$\beta~$}=~1.39 (95\%CI, 0.55; 2.24)) than those with the longest education. Cashiers had higher conccentrations of bisphenol S ({$\beta~$}=~0.99 (95\%CI, -0.11; 2.09)) but not of bisphenol A ({$\beta~$}=~-0.04 (95\%CI, -0.26; 0.19)) than unemployed women. CONCLUSIONS: Despite recent regulations, bisphenol A, triclosan and paraben detection rates were high in women and young infants. High bisphenol and paraben median levels at 12~months require further investigation as early infancy is a sensitive period for exposure to environmental contaminants.},

These include maternal or psychosocial stress (such as social stress) and exposure to endocrine-disrupting compounds (such as one of the most prevalent, bisphenol A [BPA]). In general, the evidence suggests that early environmental exposures, such as BPA and stress, lead to more pronounced behavioral deficits in males than in females, whereas female neurobehavioral patterns are more vulnerable to later in life stress. These findings highlight the importance of considering sex differences and developmental timing when examining the effects of environmental factors on later neurobehavioral outcomes.},

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between prenatal and early-life exposures to 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB-153) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-ethylene (p,p'-DDE) and behaviors in children between 5 and 9 y of age. METHODS: In the Biopersistent organochlorines in diet and human fertility: Epidemiologic studies of time to pregnancy and semen quality in Inuit and European populations (INUENDO) cohort, consisting of mother-child pairs from Greenland and Ukraine (n=1,018), maternal serum PCB-153 and p,p'-DDE concentrations were measured during pregnancy, and cumulative postnatal exposures during the first 12 months after delivery were estimated using a pharmacokinetic model. Parents completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and children's behaviors were dichotomized as abnormal (high) versus normal/borderline for five SDQ subscales and the total difficulties score. RESULTS: The total difficulties score, an overall measure of abnormal behavior, was not clearly associated with pre- or postnatal exposures to PCB-153 or to p,p'-DDE. However, pooled adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for high conduct problem scores with a doubling of exposure were 1.19 (95\% CI: 0.99, 1.42) and 1.16 (95\% CI: 0.96, 1.41) for pre- and postnatal PCB-153, respectively, and 1.25 (95\% CI: 1.04, 1.51) and 1.24 (95\% CI: 1.01, 1.51) for pre- and postnatal p,p'-DDE, respectively. Corresponding ORs for high hyperactivity scores were 1.24 (95\% CI: 0.94, 1.62) and 1.08 (95\% CI: 0.81, 1.45) for pre- and postnatal PCB-153, respectively, and 1.43 (95\% CI: 1.06, 1.92) and 1.27 (95\% CI: 0.93, 1.73) for pre- and postnatal p,p'-DDE, respectively. CONCLUSION: Prenatal and early postnatal exposures to p,p'-DDE and PCB-153 were associated with a higher prevalence of abnormal scores for conduct and hyperactivity at 5\textendash 9 y of age in our study population. These findings provide further support for the importance of minimizing organochlorine exposures to young children and to women of childbearing age. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP553.},

Two methods are provided to correct relative risk estimates obtained from logistic regression models for measurement errors in continuous exposures within cohort studies that may be due to either random (unbiased) within-person variation or to systematic errors for individual subjects. These methods require a separate validation study to estimate the regression coefficient lambda relating the surrogate measure to true exposure. In the linear approximation method, the true logistic regression coefficient beta* is estimated by beta/lambda, where beta is the observed logistic regression coefficient based on the surrogate measure. In the likelihood approximation method, a second-order Taylor series expansion is used to approximate the logistic function, enabling closed-form likelihood estimation of beta*. Confidence intervals for the corrected relative risks are provided that include a component representing error in the estimation of lambda. Based on simulation studies, both methods perform well for true odds ratios up to 3.0; for higher odds ratios the likelihood approximation method was superior with respect to both bias and coverage probability. An example is provided based on data from a prospective study of dietary fat intake and risk of breast cancer and a validation study of the questionnaire used to assess dietary fat intake.},

Unfortunately, reducing the type I error for null associations increases the type II error for those associations that are not null. The theoretical basis for advocating a routine adjustment for multiple comparisons is the "universal null hypothesis" that "chance" serves as the first-order explanation for observed phenomena. This hypothesis undermines the basic premises of empirical research, which holds that nature follows regular laws that may be studied through observations. A policy of not making adjustments for multiple comparisons is preferable because it will lead to fewer errors of interpretation when the data under evaluation are not random numbers but actual observations on nature. Furthermore, scientists should not be so reluctant to explore leads that may turn out to be wrong that they penalize themselves by missing possibly important findings.},

Here I demonstrate how analysis of genomic information can provide new insights into endocrine systems, using the human growth hormone (GH) signaling pathway as an illustrative example. GH is essential for normal postnatal growth in children, and plays important roles in other biological processes throughout life. GH actions are mediated by the GH receptor, primarily via the JAK2 protein tyrosine kinase and the STAT5B transcription factor, and inactivating mutations in this pathway all lead to impaired somatic growth. Variation in GH signaling genes has been evaluated using DNA sequence data from the Exome Aggregation Consortium, a compendium of information from {$>$}60,000 individuals. Results reveal many potential missense and other alterations in the coding regions ofGH1,GHR,JAK2, andSTAT5B, with most changes being uncommon. The total number of different alleles per gene varied by \textasciitilde threefold, from 101 forGH1 to 338 forJAK2. Several known disease-linked mutations inGH1,GHR, andJAK2 were present but infrequent in the population; however, three amino acid changes inGHR were sufficiently prevalent (\textasciitilde 4\% to 44\% of chromosomes) to suggest that they are not disease causing. Collectively, these data provide new opportunities to understand how genetically driven variability in GH signaling and action may modify human physiology and disease., Extensive population variation in GH signaling proteins predicted in a human genome database provides new opportunities to understand the range of normal GH physiology and pathophysiology.},

We designed a strategy for investigating this reprogramming, which consisted of identifying a large number of tissue-restricted genes that are epigenetically silenced in normal somatic cells and then detecting their expression in cancer. This approach led to the demonstration that large-scale ``off-context'' gene activations systematically occur in a variety of cancer types. In our series of 293 lung tumors, we identified an ectopic gene expression signature associated with a subset of highly aggressive tumors, which predicted poor prognosis independently of the TNM (tumor size, node positivity, and metastasis) stage or histological subtype. The ability to isolate these tumors allowed us to reveal their common molecular features characterized by the acquisition of embryonic stem cell/germ cell gene expression profiles and the down-regulation of immune response genes. The methodical recognition of ectopic gene activations in cancer cells could serve as a basis for gene signature\textendash guided tumor stratification, as well as for the discovery of oncogenic mechanisms, and expand the understanding of the biology of very aggressive tumors. Large-scale detection of ectopic gene activations reveals a source of potential cancer biomarkers and correlates with aggressive metastasis-prone lung tumors.

  abstract = {Phthalates (dialkyl or alkyl phenyl esters of phthalic acid, benzene-1.2-dicarboxylic acid) are a group of industrial chemicals that have been used for more than 50 years. Phthalates are ubiquitous and can potentially have adverse effects on humans. The present study presents an accurate, sensitive and automated analytical method for measuring 12 phthalate metabolites (free and conjugated) in human urine using on-line solid phase extraction coupled to high performance liquid chromatography - electrospray ionization - tandem mass spectrometry. A small volume of urine sample (300{$\mu$}L) is required. Glucoronidated phthalate metabolites are deconjugated by incubation with glucoronidase enzyme (Escherihia coli-K 12) and the reaction is stopped by adding formic acid. This is the only sample preparation needed prior to injection into the column switching system. Thus, the method involves minimal sample handling and minimizes possible contaminations from the surroundings. The method was validated by spiking synthetic urine at 5-8 levels in the range of 0.1-500ng phthalate metabolites/mL synthetic urine. The method is sensitive with limits of detection in the low nanogram range, and rapid with a total run time about 25min. The accuracy was between 90 and 120 \% and the intermediate precision was given as relative standard deviation was below 20\% for most of the compounds. The high sensitivity, high throughput and minimal manual handling make the method suitable for large-scale biomonitoring studies. The present method was applied for the determination of phthalate metabolites in urine samples from 116 pregnant women, a subproject within the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. Concentrations of all the twelve phthalate metabolites was {$>$}LOQ in 100\% of the samples analysed. Mean urinary concentrations for different phthalate metabolites ranged from 1 to 100ng/mL, the highest concentrations were observed for di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) metabolites and lowest for di-iso-nonyl phthalate (DiNP) metabolites. The urinary concentrations for most of the phthalate metabolites in the present study were found to be in the same range as found in other studies of pregnant women.},

  abstract = {According to the ``Developmental Origins of Health and Disease'' (DOHaD) concept, the early-life environment is a critical period for fetal programming. Given the epidemiological evidence that air pollution exposure during pregnancy adversely affects newborn outcomes such as birth weight and preterm birth, there is a need to pay attention to underlying modes of action to better understand not only these air pollution-induced early health effects but also its later-life consequences. In this review, we give an overview of air pollution-induced placental molecular alterations observed in the ENVIRONAGE birth cohort and evaluate the existing evidence. In general, we showed that prenatal exposure to air pollution is associated with nitrosative stress and epigenetic alterations in the placenta. Adversely affected CpG targets were involved in cellular processes including DNA repair, circadian rhythm, and energy metabolism. For miRNA expression, specific air pollution exposure windows were associated with altered miR-20a, miR-21, miR-146a, and miR-222 expression. Early-life aging markers including telomere length and mitochondrial DNA content are associated with air pollution exposure during pregnancy. Previously, we proposed the air pollution-induced telomere-mitochondrial aging hypothesis with a direct link between telomeres and mitochondria. Here, we extend this view with a potential co-interaction of different biological mechanisms on the level of placental oxidative stress, epigenetics, aging, and energy metabolism. Investigating the placenta is an opportunity for future research as it may help to understand the fundamental biology underpinning the DOHaD concept through the interactions between the underlying modes of action, prenatal environment, and disease risk in later life. To prevent lasting consequences from early-life exposures of air pollution, policy makers should get a basic understanding of biomolecular consequences and transgenerational risks.},

Most commonly, they assess DNA-methylation status at cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites, using platforms such as the Illumina 450k array that profile a subset of CpGs genome wide. An important challenge in the context of EWAS is determining a significance threshold for declaring a CpG site as differentially methylated, taking multiple testing into account. We used a permutation method to estimate a significance threshold specifically for the 450k array and a simulation extrapolation approach to estimate a genome-wide threshold. These methods were applied to five different EWAS datasets derived from a variety of populations and tissue types. We obtained an estimate of for the 450k array, and a genome-wide estimate of . We further demonstrate the importance of these results by showing that previously recommended sample sizes for EWAS should be adjusted upwards, requiring samples between {$\sim$}10\% and {$\sim$}20\% larger in order to maintain type-1 errors at the desired level.},

Due to evidence of their estrogenic activity, they have been considered as chemicals of concern. The exposure of the Norwegian population to these compounds is presently unknown. AIMS: To measure urinary levels of twelve different environmental phenols including four emerging bisphenols: S, F, B and AF (abbreviated as BPS, BPF, BPB and BPAF, respectively) in a healthy Norwegian population. We have calculated short-term variability, estimated daily intakes and investigated important determinants of exposure. METHODS: Urine samples were collected from mothers (n = 48) and their children (n = 56) during spring/summer 2012 in two counties in Norway. RESULTS: Six environmental phenols namely methyl, ethyl and propyl paraben, BPA, BP-3 and TCS were detected in almost 100\% of the urine samples. Among the emerging bisphenols, BPS was detected most frequently in the urine samples (42-48\%) followed by BPF (4-15\%). Parabens were positively and significantly correlated to each other in both mothers and children. Levels of parabens and BP-3 were higher in mothers compared to children. All mothers and children had lower estimated daily intakes (back calculated from the urinary concentrations) of parabens and BPA than the respective acceptable and tolerable daily intakes (ADIs and TDIs) established by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Observed intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) indicated moderate to high reliability of spot urine measurements for all the environmental phenols (ICCs: 0.70-0.97). Use of hair products, deodorants, face and hand creams were significantly associated with higher urinary levels of parabens. CONCLUSIONS: Occurrence of environmental phenols in healthy Norwegian women and children is abundant. Among emerging bisphenols, there is widespread exposure to BPS. A single spot urine sample can be used for estimating short-term exposures of environmental phenols. Urinary levels of parabens were associated with use of PCPs.},

In recent years, a growing body of evidence suggests that environmental exposure to other metals including arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), manganese (Mn), and their mixtures also pose public health threats. In this paper we summarize the recent literature examining the relationship of prenatal and childhood environmental metal exposures with cognitive and behavioral outcomes in children. We conducted a literature search to identify epidemiologic studies that examined the relationship of Cd, Mn, and metal mixtures with children's neurodevelopmental/cognitive and behavioral outcomes. We restricted the search to peer-reviewed studies published in English between January 2009 and March 2015. We identified a total of 31 articles of which 16, 17, and 16 studies examined the effects of Cd, Mn, or metal mixtures, respectively. Based on our review, there is suggestive evidence that prenatal/childhood Cd exposure may be associated with poorer cognition, but additional research is clearly needed. We found little evidence of behavioral effects of early life Cd exposure, and no studies found a significant relationship with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Studies of early life Mn exposure consistently reported negative impacts on both cognition and behavior. There is also growing evidence that co-exposure to multiple metals can result in increased neurotoxicity compared to single metal exposures, in particular during early life. Few studies have evaluated behavioral effects related to metal co-exposures.},

  abstract = {DNA methylation is the most studied epigenetic mark and CpG methylation is central to many biological processes and human diseases. Since cancer has highlighted the contribution to disease of aberrant DNA methylation patterns, such as the presence of promoter CpG island hypermethylation-associated silencing of tumor suppressor genes and global DNA hypomethylation defects, their importance will surely become apparent in other pathologies. However, advances in obtaining comprehensive DNA methylomes are hampered by the high cost and time-consuming aspects of the single nucleotide methods currently available for whole genome DNA methylation analyses. Following the success of the standard CpG methylation microarrays for 1,505 CpG sites and 27,000 CpG sites, we have validated in vivo the newly developed 450,000 (450K) cytosine microarray (Illumina). The 450K microarray includes CpG and CNG sites, CpG islands/shores/shelves/open sea, non-coding RNA (microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs) and sites surrounding the transcription start sites (-200 bp to -1,500 bp, 5'-UTRs and exons 1) for coding genes, but also for the corresponding gene bodies and 3'-UTRs, in addition to intergenic regions derived from GWAS studies. Herein, we demonstrate that the 450K DNA methylation array can consistently and significantly detect CpG methylation changes in the HCT-116 colorectal cancer cell line in comparison with normal colon mucosa or HCT-116 cells with defective DNA methyltransferases (DKO). The provided validation highlights the potential use of the 450K DNA methylation microarray as a useful tool for ongoing and newly designed epigenome projects.},

  abstract = {Methods: We used individual participant data from 218,216 pregnant women participating in 33 cohorts from Europe, North America, and Oceania. Of these women, 9065 (4.2\%), 148,697 (68.1\%), 42,678 (19.6\%), 13,084 (6.0\%), 3597 (1.6\%), and 1095 (0.5\%) were underweight, normal weight, overweight, and grades 1, 2, and 3 obese women, respectively. A total of 138, 517 women from 26 cohorts had pregnancies with no hypertensive or diabetic disorders and with term deliveries of appropriate for gestational age at birth infants. Gestational weight gain charts for underweight, normal weight, overweight, and grade 1, 2, and 3 obese women were derived by the Box-Cox t method using the generalized additive model for location, scale, and shape. Results: We observed that gestational weight gain strongly differed per maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index group. The median (interquartile range) gestational weight gain at 40 weeks was 14.2 kg (11.4\textendash 17.4) for underweight women, 14.5 kg (11.5\textendash 17.7) for normal weight women, 13.9 kg (10.1\textendash 17.9) for overweight women, and 11.2 kg (7.0\textendash 15.7), 8.7 kg (4.3\textendash 13.4) and 6.3 kg (1.9\textendash 11.1) for grades 1, 2, and 3 obese women, respectively. The rate of weight gain was lower in the first half than in the second half of pregnancy. No differences in the patterns of weight gain were observed between cohorts or countries. Similar weight gain patterns were observed in mothers without pregnancy complications. Conclusions: Gestational weight gain patterns are strongly related to pre-pregnancy body mass index. The derived charts can be used to assess gestational weight gain in etiological research and as a monitoring tool for weight gain during pregnancy in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {The exposome represents the totality of life course environmental exposures (including lifestyle and other non-genetic factors), from the prenatal period onwards. This holistic concept of exposure provides a new framework to advance the understanding of complex and multifactorial diseases. Prospective pregnancy and birth cohort studies provide a unique opportunity for exposome research as they are able to capture, from prenatal life onwards, both the external (including lifestyle, chemical, social and wider community-level exposures) and the internal (including inflammation, metabolism, epigenetics, and gut microbiota) domains of the exposome. In this paper, we describe the steps required for applying an exposome approach, describe the main strengths and limitations of different statistical approaches and discuss their challenges, with the aim to provide guidance for methodological choices in the analysis of exposome data in birth cohort studies. An exposome approach implies selecting, pre-processing, describing and analyzing a large set of exposures. Several statistical methods are currently available to assess exposome-health associations, which differ in terms of research question that can be answered, of balance between sensitivity and false discovery proportion, and between computational complexity and simplicity (parsimony). Assessing the association between many exposures and health still raises many exposure assessment issues and statistical challenges. The exposome favors a holistic approach of environmental influences on health, which is likely to allow a more complete understanding of disease etiology.},

  abstract = {Exposure to pesticides is a major factor in the cause of dysfunction in the nervous system and neurodevelopment disorders in children at critical periods of great vulnerability. The aim of this study was to review scientific evidence published on neurodevelopmental effects of prenatal and postnatal exposure to organophosphate pesticides (OPs) in different stages, including neonates, infants, toddlers, preschool children, and school-age children. Full-text articles published in PubMed, Scopus, and ISI databases between 1973 and 2019 were reviewed and the scientific evidence was evaluated. Results: Fifty studies were eligible for inclusion in this quantitative synthesis. Fifteen of these papers evaluated the effects on neonates and infants, 18 on the effects on toddlers and preschool children, and 24 the effects on school-age children. Considerable evidence suggests that prenatal exposure to OPs contributes to child neurodevelopment disorders in all stages, whereas data about the effects of postnatal exposure are limited. Therefore, the available evidence supports the theory that sensitive time-windows occur prenatally rather than postnatally. Although 45 out of the total 50 selected articles found an association between OP exposure and child neurodevelopment, some of the evidence is controversial. A standardized methodology is needed to enable the comparison of the results in several studies, and further research studies are needed to warrant firmer conclusions. A systematic review of this evidence should be performed continuously to update the state of knowledge regarding neurodevelopmental effects associated with OP exposure.},

  abstract = {Increased occurrence of reproductive disorders has raised concerns regarding the impact of endocrine-disrupting chemicals on reproductive health, especially when such exposure occurs during fetal life. Prenatal testosterone (T) treatment leads to growth retardation, postnatal hypergonadotropism, compromised estradiol-positive feedback, polycystic ovaries, and infertility in the adult. Prenatal dihydrotestosterone treatment failed to affect ovarian morphology or estradiol-positive feedback, suggesting that effects of prenatal T may be facilitated via conversion of T to estradiol, thus raising concerns regarding fetal exposure to estrogenic endocrine-disrupting chemicals. This study tested whether fetal exposure to methoxychlor (MXC) or bisphenol A (BPA) would disrupt cyclicity in the ewe. Suffolk ewes were administered MXC (n=10), BPA (n=10) (5 mg/kg.d sc in cotton seed oil) or the vehicle (C; n=16) from d 30 to 90 of gestation. On d 60 of treatment, maternal MXC concentrations in fat tissue and BPA in blood averaged approximately 200 microg/g fat and 37.4+/-3.3 ng/ml, respectively. Birth weights of BPA offspring were lower (P{$<$}0.05) relative to C. There was no difference in the time of puberty between groups. BPA females were hypergonadotropic during early postnatal life and ended their breeding season later, compared with C. Characterization of cyclic changes after synchronization with prostaglandin F2alpha in five C, six MXC, and six BPA females found that the onset of the LH surge was delayed in MXC (P{$<$}0.05) and the LH surge magnitude severely dampened (P{$<$}0.05) in BPA sheep. These findings suggest that prenatal BPA and MXC exposure have long-term differential effects on a variety of reproductive endocrine parameters that could impact fertility.},

  abstract = {Lipid traits (total, low-density and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides) are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. DNA methylation is not only an inherited but also modifiable epigenetic mark that has been related to cardiovascular risk factors. Our aim was to identify loci showing differential DNA methylation related to serum lipid levels. Blood DNA methylation was assessed using the Illumina Human Methylation 450 BeadChip. A two-stage epigenome-wide association study was performed, with a discovery sample in the REGICOR study (n\,=\,645) and validation in the Framingham Offspring Study (n\,=\,2,542). Fourteen CpG sites located in nine genes (SREBF1, SREBF2, PHOSPHO1, SYNGAP1, ABCG1, CPT1A, MYLIP, TXNIP and SLC7A11) and 2 intergenic regions showed differential methylation in association with lipid traits. Six of these genes and 1 intergenic region were new discoveries showing differential methylation related to total cholesterol (SREBF2), HDL-cholesterol (PHOSPHO1, SYNGAP1 and an intergenic region in chromosome 2) and triglycerides (MYLIP, TXNIP and SLC7A11). These CpGs explained 0.7\%, 9.5\% and 18.9\% of the variability of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides in the Framingham Offspring Study, respectively. The expression of the genes SREBF2 and SREBF1 was inversely associated with methylation of their corresponding CpGs (P-value\,=\,0.0042 and 0.0045, respectively) in participants of the GOLDN study (n\,=\,98). In turn, SREBF1 expression was directly associated with HDL cholesterol (P-value\,=\,0.0429). Genetic variants in SREBF1, PHOSPHO1, ABCG1 and CPT1A were also associated with lipid profile. Further research is warranted to functionally validate these new loci and assess the causality of new and established associations between these differentially methylated loci and lipid metabolism.},

  abstract = {Copper is an important trace element that is required for essential enzymes. However, due to its redox activity, copper can also lead to the generation of toxic reactive oxygen species. Therefore, cellular uptake, storage as well as export of copper have to be tightly regulated in order to guarantee sufficient copper supply for the synthesis of copper-containing enzymes but also to prevent copper-induced oxidative stress. In brain, copper is of importance for normal development. In addition, both copper deficiency as well as excess of copper can seriously affect brain functions. Therefore, this organ possesses ample mechanisms to regulate its copper metabolism. In brain, astrocytes are considered as important regulators of copper homeostasis. Impairments of homeostatic mechanisms in brain copper metabolism have been associated with neurodegeneration in human disorders such as Menkes disease, Wilson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. This review article will summarize the biological functions of copper in the brain and will describe the current knowledge on the mechanisms involved in copper transport, storage and export of brain cells. The role of copper in diseases that have been connected with disturbances in brain copper homeostasis will also be discussed.},

Often the analysis of complex tissues and cell mixtures is the only feasible option to study methylation changes across large patient cohorts. Since DNA methylomes are highly cell type specific, deconvolution methods can be used to recover cell type\textendash specific information in the form of latent methylation components (LMCs) from such `bulk' samples. Reference-free deconvolution methods retrieve these components without the need for DNA methylation profiles of purified cell types. Currently no integrated and guided procedure is available for data preparation and subsequent interpretation of deconvolution results. Here, we describe a three-stage protocol for reference-free deconvolution of DNA methylation data comprising: (i) data preprocessing, confounder adjustment using independent component analysis (ICA) and feature selection using DecompPipeline, (ii) deconvolution with multiple parameters using MeDeCom, RefFreeCellMix or EDec and (iii) guided biological inference and validation of deconvolution results with the R/Shiny graphical user interface FactorViz. Our protocol simplifies the analysis and guides the initial interpretation of DNA methylation data derived from complex samples. The harmonized approach is particularly useful to dissect and evaluate cell heterogeneity in complex systems such as tumors. We apply the protocol to lung cancer methylomes from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and show that our approach identifies the proportions of stromal cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells, as well as associations of the detected components with clinical parameters.

  abstract = {Overadjustment is defined inconsistently. This term is meant to describe control (eg, by regression adjustment, stratification, or restriction) for a variable that either increases net bias or decreases precision without affecting bias. We define overadjustment bias as control for an intermediate variable (or a descending proxy for an intermediate variable) on a causal path from exposure to outcome. We define unnecessary adjustment as control for a variable that does not affect bias of the causal relation between exposure and outcome but may affect its precision. We use causal diagrams and an empirical example (the effect of maternal smoking on neonatal mortality) to illustrate and clarify the definition of overadjustment bias, and to distinguish overadjustment bias from unnecessary adjustment. Using simulations, we quantify the amount of bias associated with overadjustment. Moreover, we show that this bias is based on a different causal structure from confounding or selection biases. Overadjustment bias is not a finite sample bias, while inefficiencies due to control for unnecessary variables are a function of sample size.},

Recent data on bioaccumulation in wildlife and humans point to a need for in-depth analyses of systemic toxicology, in particular with respect to reproduction and ontogeny. We examined six frequently used UVA and UVB screens for estrogenicity in vitro and in vivo. In MCF-7 breast cancer cells, five out of six chemicals, that is, benzophenone-3 (Bp-3), homosalate (HMS), 4-methyl-benzylidene camphor (4-MBC), octyl-methoxycinnamate (OMC), and octyl-dimethyl-PABA (OD-PABA), increased cell proliferation with median effective concentrations (EC(50)) values between 1.56 and 3.73 microM, whereas butyl-methoxydibenzoylmethane (B-MDM) was inactive. Further evidence for estrogenic activity was the induction of pS2 protein in MCF-7 cells and the blockade of the proliferative effect of 4-MBC by the estrogen antagonist ICI 182,780. In the uterotrophic assay using immature Long-Evans rats that received the chemicals for 4 days in powdered feed, uterine weight was dose-dependently increased by 4-MBC (ED(50 )309mg/kg/day), OMC (ED(50) 935 mg/kg/day), and weakly by Bp-3 (active at 1,525 mg/kg/day). Three compounds were inactive by the oral route in the doses tested. Dermal application of 4-MBC to immature hairless (hr/hr) rats also increased uterine weight at concentrations of 5 and 7.5\% in olive oil. Our findings indicate that UV screens should be tested for endocrine activity, in view of possible long-term effects in humans and wildlife.},

A notable feature of boosting is that the technique has a built-in mechanism for shrinking coefficient estimates and variable selection. This regularization mechanism makes boosting a suitable method for analyzing data characterized by small sample sizes and large numbers of predictors. We extend the existing methodology by developing a boosting method for prediction functions with multiple components. Such multidimensional functions occur in many types of statistical models, for example in count data models and in models involving outcome variables with a mixture distribution. As will be demonstrated, the new algorithm is suitable for both the estimation of the prediction function and regularization of the estimates. In addition, nuisance parameters can be estimated simultaneously with the prediction function.},

We hypothesized that the glucocorticoid receptor (Gr, Nr3c1) fashions the DNA methylation profile of offspring. Consistent with this hypothesis, fetal Nr3c1 heterozygosity leads to altered DNA methylation landscape in fetal placenta in a sex-specific manner. There was a significant overlap of differentially methylated genes in fetal placenta and adult frontal cortex in Nr3c1 heterozygotes. Phenotypically, Nr3c1 heterozygotes show significantly more anxiety-like behavior than wildtype. DNA methylation status of fetal placental tissue is significantly correlated with anxiety-like behavior of the same animals in adulthood. Thus, placental DNA methylation might predict behavioral phenotypes in adulthood. Our data supports the hypothesis that Nr3c1 influences DNA methylation at birth and that DNA methylation in placenta correlates with adult frontal cortex DNA methylation and anxiety-like phenotypes.},

In the MARBLES prospective pregnancy study of high-risk younger siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), pregnancy and environmental factors collected by maternal interviews were examined as predictors of placental DNA methylation, including partially methylated domains (PMDs), an embryonic feature of the placental methylome. DNA methylation data from MethylC-seq analysis of 47 placentas of children clinically diagnosed at 3 years with ASD or typical development using standardized assessments were examined in relation to: child's gestational age, birthweight, and diagnosis; maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index, smoking, education, parity, height, prenatal vitamin and folate intake; home ownership; pesticides professionally applied to lawns or gardens or inside homes, pet flea/tick pouches, collars, or soaps/shampoos used in the 3 months prior to or during pregnancy. Sequencing run, order, and coverage, and child race and sex were considered as potential confounders. Akaike information criterion was used to select the most parsimonious among candidate models. Final prediction models used sandwich estimators to produce homoscadisticity-robust estimates of the 95\% confidence interval (CI) and P-values controlled the false discovery rate at 5\%. The strongest, most robust associations were between pesticides professionally applied outside the home and higher average methylation over PMDs [0.45 (95\% CI 0.17, 0.72), P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.03] and a reduced proportion of the genome in PMDs [\`A0.42 (95\% CI \`A 0.67 to \`A 0.17), P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.03].

It enables the identification and characterization of relationships among multiple factors. It also enables the identification of prognostically relevant risk factors and the calculation of risk scores for individual prognostication. Methods: This article is based on selected textbooks of statistics, a selective review of the literature, and our own experience. Results: After a brief introduction of the uni- and multivariable regression models, illustrative examples are given to explain what the important considerations are before a regression analysis is performed, and how the results should be interpreted. The reader should then be able to judge whether the method has been used correctly and interpret the results appropriately. Conclusion: The performance and interpretation of linear regression analysis are subject to a variety of pitfalls, which are discussed here in detail. The reader is made aware of common errors of interpretation through practical examples. Both the opportunities for applying linear regression analysis and its limitations are presented. {$\blackpointerright$}Cite this as: Schneider A, Hommel G, Blettner M: Linear regression analysis\textemdash part 14 of a series on evaluation of scientific publications.

Experimental animal studies do not suggest increased malformations after therapeutic use of single-ingredient acetaminophen during pregnancy. Cohort studies in humans in which exposure is prospectively ascertained show no detectable increase in congenital malformation risk associated with single-ingredient acetaminophen use during pregnancy. A case\textendash control study identified an association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and risk of gastroschisis in the offspring, but the study was limited by recall bias, unblinded interviewers, possible misclassification of gastroschisis, confounding by indication, difficulty in separating out the effects of combination products, and possible selection bias. Two case\textendash control studies failed to identify a statistically significant association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and gastroschisis. No other malformation has been shown to be causally associated with single-ingredient acetaminophen. A reported association between pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, and acetaminophen may be explained by reverse causation. Concerns expressed about childhood asthma and prenatal acetaminophen use has been addressed in a separate review. The use of single-ingredient acetaminophen during pregnancy can be justified based on outcome data. Data on the effects of acetaminophen cannot necessarily be extended to acetaminophen combination products.},

It is estimated that between 10 and 40\% of the variance associated with ADHD is likely to be accounted for by environmental factors. There is considerable interest in the role that the prenatal environment might play in the development of ADHD with previous reviews concluding that despite demonstration of associations between prenatal risk factors (e.g. prematurity, maternal smoking during pregnancy) and ADHD, there remains insufficient evidence to support a definite causal relationship. This article provides an update of research investigating the relationship between prenatal risk factors and ADHD published over the past 3~years. Recently, several epidemiological and data linkage studies have made substantial contributions to our understanding of this relationship. In particular, these studies have started to account for some of the genetic and familial confounds that, when taken into account, throw several established findings into doubt. None of the proposed prenatal risk factors can be confirmed as causal for ADHD, and the stronger the study design, the less likely it is to support an association. We need a new benchmark for studies investigating the etiology of ADHD whereby there is an expectation not only that data will be collected prospectively but also that the design allows the broad range of genetic and familial factors to be accounted for.},

  abstract = {Ototoxicity is known to cause permanent loss of vestibule function through degeneration of sensory hair cells (HCs). However, functional recovery has been reported during washout after chronic ototoxicity, although the mechanisms underlying this reversible dysfunction are unknown. Here, we study this question in rats chronically exposed to the ototoxic compound 3,3{${'}$}-iminodipropionitrile (IDPN). Pronounced alterations in vestibular function appeared before significant loss of HCs or stereociliary coalescence became evident by ultrastructural analyses. This early dysfunction was fully reversible if the exposure was terminated promptly. In cristae and utricles, the distinct junctions formed between type I HCs (HCI) and calyx endings were completely dismantled at these early stages of reversible dysfunction, and completely rebuilt during washout. Immunohistochemical observations revealed loss and recovery of the junction proteins CASPR1 and tenascin-C and RT-PCR indicated that their loss was not due to decreased gene expression. KCNQ4 was mislocalized during intoxication and recovered control-like localization after washout. At early stages of the intoxication, the calyces could be classified as showing intact or lost junctions, indicating that calyceal junction dismantlement is triggered on a calyx-by-calyx basis. Chronic toxicity also altered the presence of ribeye, PSD-95 and GluA2 puncta in the calyces. These synaptic alterations varied between the two types of calyx endings (formed by calyx-only or dimorphic afferents) and some persisted at the end of the washout period. The present data reveal new forms of plasticity of the calyx endings in adult mammals, including a robust capacity for rebuilding the calyceal junction. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the phenomena involved in progressive vestibular dysfunction and its potential recovery during and after ototoxic exposure.},

  abstract = {Ordinal data are used in a lot of domains, especially when measurements are collected from people by observations, testings, or questionnaires. ordinalClust is an innovative R package dedicated to ordinal data that proposes tools for modeling, clustering, co-clustering and classifying them. Ordinal data are modeled by the BOS distribution, which is a model with two meaningful parameters referred to as ``position" and ``precision". The first one indicates the mode of the distributed and the other ones describes how scattered are data around the mode: the user is able to interpret easily the distribution of their data when they are given these two parameters. The package is based on the co-clustering framework (when rows and columns are simultaneously clustered). The co-clustering approach uses the Latent Block Model (LBM) and the SEM-Gibbs algorithm for the parameters inference. On the other hand, the clustering and the classification methods follow on from simplified versions of this algorithm. Indeed, the clustering can be seen as a simpler co-clustering whose column-clusters are not to be found. In the same way, classification can be seen as a simpler co-clustering whose row-clusters are not to be found on the training set. For the classification process, two approaches are proposed. In the first one, the BOS parameters are estimated on the training data set in a classic way. In the second approach parsimony is introduced by estimating the parameters and column-clusters on the training data set. We empirically show that this approach can yield better results. For the clustering and co-clustering process, the ICL-BIC criterion is used for model selection purposes. An overview of these methods is given, and the way of using them with the ordinalClust package is described through real data sets. The latest stable package version is available in source and binary form on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).},

NGS allows massive parallel sequencing that affords maximal tumor genomic assessment. NGS approaches are different, and concern DNA and RNA analysis. DNA sequencing includes whole-genome, whole-exome, and targeted sequencing, which focuses on a selection of genes of interest for a specific disease. RNA sequencing facilitates the detection of alternative gene-spliced transcripts, posttranscriptional modifications, gene fusion, mutations/single-nucleotide polymorphisms, small and long noncoding RNAs, and changes in gene expression. Most applications are in the cancer research field, but lately NGS technology has been revolutionizing cancer molecular diagnostics, due to the many advantages it offers compared to traditional methods. There is greater knowledge on solid cancer diagnostics, and recent interest has been shown also in the field of hematologic cancer. In this review, we report the latest data on NGS diagnostic/predictive clinical applications in solid and hematologic cancers. Moreover, since the amount of NGS data produced is very large and their interpretation is very complex, we briefly discuss two bioinformatic aspects, variantcalling accuracy and copy-number variation detection, which are gaining a lot of importance in cancer-diagnostic assessment.},

  abstract = {Many epidemiological studies have reported a positive association between prenatal exposure to paracetamol and childhood wheezing and asthma. We investigated whether the link between prenatal analgesic exposure and asthma/wheeze is specific to paracetamol, and whether it is causal or confounded.             Using linked Swedish health register data we investigated the relation between various prescribed analgesics in pregnancy and the risk of childhood asthma/wheeze in a population of 492{$\mkern1mu$}999, and used negative paternal control and sibling comparison approaches to explore unmeasured confounding.                            After controlling for potential confounders, prescribed opioids, antimigraine drugs and paracetamol were all positively associated with childhood asthma/wheeze risk at all ages (               e.g.               for asthma/wheeze at age 4\hspace{0.25em}years: adjusted OR 1.39 (95\% CI 1.30\textendash 1.49), 1.19 (95\% CI 1.01\textendash 1.40) and 1.47 (95\% CI 1.36\textendash 1.59) for opioids, antimigraine drugs and paracetamol, respectively). The results of the paternal control analysis did not suggest the presence of unmeasured confounding by genetics or shared environment. However, the sibling control analysis broadly suggested that associations between prenatal exposure to the analgesics and asthma/wheeze were confounded by specific maternal factors (               e.g.               for asthma/wheeze at age 4\hspace{0.25em}years: adjusted OR 0.91 (95\% CI 0.62\textendash 1.31), 0.50 (95\% CI 0.17\textendash 1.45) and 0.80 (95\% CI 0.50\textendash 1.29) for opioids, antimigraine drugs and paracetamol, respectively).                          We propose that analgesic use in pregnancy does not cause childhood asthma/wheeze and that the association is confounded by unmeasured factors that are intrinsic to the mother, such as chronic pain or anxiety.},

We chose dopamine receptor genes (DRD1 and DRD2), NCAM, and COMT as examples of genes with CpG islands around the promoter region, and serotonin receptor genes (HTR2A and HTR3A), HCRT, and DRD3 as genes without CpG islands. Methylation states were investigated in fetal brain, fetal liver, placenta, and in adult peripheral leukocytes from three individuals by Southern blot and bisulfite-modified DNA sequencing. A repetitive sequence, human endogenous retrovirus (HERV)-K was also examined. All genes examined were almost completely unmethylated in brains. The genes with CpG islands were unmethylated regardless of their expression state. In contrast, genes without CpG islands showed various methylation patterns, which did not necessarily reflect the transcriptional activity of the genes. Most HERV-K loci were methylated, but some loci showed relatively low methylation in the placenta and liver. Interestingly, we found inter-individual differences in methylation levels in HTR2A and HCRT in the placenta and in some loci of HERV-K in the placenta and liver. The sample with the lowest methylation levels in the two unique genes showed higher methylation of HERV-K loci than the other samples. These results provide detailed information about the methylation states of the genes analyzed and evidence for inter-individual variations in methylation in both unique and repetitive sequences.},

DNA methylation was analyzed using the Illumina Infinium Human MethylationEPIC BeadChip microarrays and verified via pyrosequencing and reverse transcription-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Functional enrichment analysis were constructed by gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis based on the differentially methylated regions between LGA and AGA groups.Clinical investigation showed that LGA newborns had significantly lower hemoglobin and blood glucose compared to AGA newborns. Birth weight was negatively correlated to hemoglobin and blood glucose. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis identified 17 244 methylation variable positions achieving genome-wide significance (adjusted P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}.05). 34\% methylation variable positions were located in the gene promoter region. A total of 117 differentially methylated regions were revealed by bump hunting analysis, which mapped to 107 genes. Function analysis showed 13 genes enriched in "adhesion and infection process, endocrine and other factor-regulated calcium reabsorption, calcium signaling pathway and transmembrane transport". Four genes linked to type II diabetes mellitus. Among the 13 genes, we selected GNAS and calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 G for independent verification of pyrosequencing, and the messenger ribonucleic acid levels of guanine nucleotide binding protein, calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 G, DECR1, and FK506 binding protein 11 were verified by reverse transcription-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.DNA methylation variation and gene expression differences in placental samples were associated with LGA newborns, which linking the effect of intrauterine environment to regulation of the offspring's gene expression. Furthermore, pathway analysis suggested that intrauterine environment affecting fetal growth might had a functional impact on multiple signaling pathways involved in fetal growth, metabolism, and inflammation. Further studies were required to understand the differences of methylation patterns.},

We performed a comprehensive Epigenome-Wide Association Study (EWAS) to identify associations between breastfeeding and DNAm patterns in childhood.

The feeding method was categorized as breastfeeding duration {$>$}3 months and {$>$}6 months, and exclusive breastfeeding duration {$>$}3 months. EWASs using robust linear regression were performed to identify differentially methylated positions (DMPs) in breastfed and non-breastfed children at age 10 (false discovery rate of 5\%). Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified using comb-p. The persistence of significant associations was evaluated in neonates and individuals at 18 and 26 years. Two DMPs, in genes SNX25 and LINC00840, were significantly associated with breastfeeding duration {$>$}6 months at 10 years and was replicated for {$>$}3 months of exclusive breastfeeding. Additionally, a significant DMR spanning the gene FDFT1 was identified in 10-year-old children who were exposed to a breastfeeding duration {$>$}3 months. None of these signals persisted to 18 or 26 years. This study lends further support for a suggestive role of DNAm in the known benefits of breastfeeding on a child's future health.},

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of glutathione S-transferase (GST) polymorphisms on the association between prenatal exposure to parabens and birth outcomes. Methods: We conducted a multivariate analysis involving 177 subjects to determine the association between paraben concentrations and birth outcomes in mothers with GST mu 1 (GSTM1) and GST theta 1 (GSTT1) polymorphisms from 2017 to 2019. Furthermore, we determined the interactive effect between paraben levels and GSTM1/GSTT1 polymorphisms using regression analysis, in addition to a generalized linear model after stratifying GSTM1/GSTT1 genotype into three categories. Results: Methyl and propyl paraben concentrations were significantly and positively associated with birth weight (methyl, {$\beta$} = 116.525, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 22.460\textendash 210.590; propyl, {$\beta$} = 82.352, 95\% CI = 9.147\textendash 155.557) in individuals with the GSTM1-null genotype. Moreover, the propyl paraben concentration was significantly associated with an increase in gestational age ({$\beta$} = 0.312, 95\% CI = 0.085\textendash 0.539) in individuals with the GSTM1-null genotype. Conclusions: This study reported the association between prenatal paraben exposure and birth outcomes in individuals with GST polymorphisms. We found positive relationships of maternal exposure to methyl parabens with birth weight in both mothers with GSTM1 and GSTT1-null genotypes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phthalates are environmental contaminants commonly used as plasticizers in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) products. Recently, exposure to phthalates has been associated with preterm birth, low birth weight, and pregnancy loss. There is limited information about the possible mechanisms linking maternal phthalate exposure and placental development, but one such mechanism may be mediated by peroxisome proliferator\textendash activated receptor {$\gamma$} (PPAR{$\gamma$}). PPAR{$\gamma$} belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily that regulates, in a ligand-dependent manner, the transcription of target genes. Studies of PPAR{$\gamma$}-deficient mice have demonstrated its essential role in lipid metabolism and placental development. In the human placenta, PPAR{$\gamma$} is expressed in the villous cytotrophoblast (VCT) and is activated during its differentiation into syncytiotrophoblast. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to investigate the action of mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) on PPAR{$\gamma$} activity during in vitro differentiation of VCTs. METHODS: We combined immunofluorescence, PPAR{$\gamma$} activity/hCG assays, western blotting, and lipidomics analyses to characterize the impacts of physiologically relevant concentrations of MEHP (0.1, 1, and 10 {$\mu$}M) on cultured VCTs isolated from human term placentas. RESULTS: Doses of 0.1 and 1 {$\mu$}M MEHP showed significantly lower PPAR{$\gamma$} activity and less VCT differentiation in comparison with controls, whereas, surprisingly, a 10 {$\mu$}M dose had the opposite effect. MEHP exposure inhibited hCG production and significantly altered lipid composition. In addition, MEHP had significant effects on the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that MEHP has a U-shaped dose\textendash response effect on trophoblast differentiation that is mediated by the PPAR{$\gamma$} pathway and acts as an endocrine disruptor in the human placenta. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP3730.},

In order to explicitly capture the properties of the data, we design a deep neural network, which composes of several stacked binary restricted Boltzmann machines, to learn the low-dimensional deep features of the DNA methylation data. Experimental results show that these features perform best in breast cancer DNA methylation data cluster analysis, compared with some state-of-the-art methods.},

Human exposure to these compounds is unavoidable, and therefore their mechanisms of toxicity should be investigated. Due to their structure and function, human erythrocytes are increasingly used as a cell model for testing the in vitro toxicity of various xenobiotics. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to assess the effect of selected phthalates on methemoglobin (metHb), reactive oxygen species (ROS) including hydroxyl radical levels, as well as the activity of antioxidative enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), in human erythrocytes. Erythrocytes were incubated with di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP), and their metabolites, i.e., mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP) and monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 100 \textmu g/mL for 6 or 24 h. This study shows that the analyzed phthalates disturbed the redox balance in human erythrocytes. DBP and BBP, at much lower concentrations than their metabolites, caused a statistically significant increase of metHb and ROS, including hydroxyl radical levels, and changed the activity of antioxidant enzymes. The studied phthalates disturbed the redox balance in human erythrocytes, which may contribute to the accelerated removal of these cells from the circulation.},

Validated analytical methods to measure trace concentrations of phthalate metabolites in humans are essential for assessing exposure to phthalates. Previously, we developed a sensitive and accurate automated analytical method for measuring up to 16 phthalate metabolites in human urine by using on-line solid phase extraction coupled with isotope dilution\textendash high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)\textendash electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. To include the measurement of seven additional analytes, including oxidative metabolites of diisononyl and diisodecyl phthalates, two chemicals used extensively in numerous consumer products, we used a novel nontraditional HPLC solvent gradient program. With this approach, we achieved adequate resolution and sensitivity for all 22 analytes with limits of detection in the low ng/mL range, without increasing the analytical run time. The method also has high accuracy with automatic recovery correction, high precision, and excellent sample throughput with minimal matrix effects. Although it is possible to measure these 22 phthalate metabolites with adequate precision and accuracy at sub-parts-per-billion levels, additional information, including toxicokinetic data, is needed to demonstrate the usefulness of these phthalate metabolites for exposure assessment purposes .},

  abstract = {The epigenetic effects on DNA methylation, histone modification, and expression of non-coding RNAs (including microRNAs) of environmental chemicals such as bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates have expanded our understanding of the etiology of human complex diseases such as cancers and diabetes. Multiple lines of evidence from in vitro and in vivo models have established that epigenetic modifications caused by in utero exposure to environmental toxicants can induce alterations in gene expression that may persist throughout life. Epigenetics is an important mechanism in the ability of environmental chemicals to influence health and disease, and BPA and phthalates are epigenetically toxic. The epigenetic effect of BPA was clearly demonstrated in viable yellow mice by decreasing CpG methylation upstream of the Agouti gene, and the hypomethylating effect of BPA was prevented by maternal dietary supplementation with a methyl donor like folic acid or the phytoestrogen genistein. Histone H3 was found to be trimethylated at lysine 27 by BPA effect on EZH2 in a human breast cancer cell line and mice. BPA exposure of human placental cell lines has been shown to alter microRNA expression levels, and specifically, miR-146a was strongly induced by BPA treatment. In human breast cancer MCF7 cells, treatment with the phthalate BBP led to demethylation of estrogen receptor (ESR1) promoter-associated CpG islands, indicating that altered ESR1 mRNA expression by BBP is due to aberrant DNA methylation. Maternal exposure to phthalate DEHP was also shown to increase DNA methylation and expression levels of DNA methyltransferases in mouse testis. Further, some epigenetic effects of BPA and phthalates in female rats were found to be transgenerational. Finally, the available new technologies for global analysis of epigenetic alterations will provide insight into the extent and patterns of alterations between human normal and diseased tissues. In vitro models such as human embryonic stem cells may be extremely useful in bettering the understanding of epigenetic effects on human development, health and disease, because the formation of embryoid bodies in vitro is very similar to the early stage of embryogenesis.},

  abstract = {The exposome concept was defined in 2005 as encompassing all environmental exposures from conception onwards, as a new strategy to evidence environmental disease risk factors. Although very appealing, the exposome concept is challenging in many respects. In terms of assessment, several hundreds of time-varying exposures need to be considered, but increasing the number of exposures assessed should not be done at the cost of increased exposure misclassification. Accurately assessing the exposome currently requires numerous measurements, which rely on different technologies; resulting in an expensive set of protocols. In the future, high-throughput 'omics technologies may be a promising technique to integrate a wide range of exposures from a small numbers of biological matrices. Assessing the association between many exposures and health raises statistical challenges. Due to the correlation structure of the exposome, existing statistical methods cannot fully and efficiently untangle the exposures truly affecting the health outcome from correlated exposures. Other statistical challenges relate to accounting for exposure misclassification or identifying synergistic effects between exposures. On-going exposome projects are trying to overcome technical and statistical challenges. From a public health perspective, a better understanding of the environmental risk factors should open the way to improved prevention strategies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The widespread detection of perfluoroalkyl acids and their derivatives in wildlife and humans, and their entry into the immature brain, raise increasing concern about whether these agents might be developmental neurotoxicants. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonamide (PFOSA), and perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) in undifferentiated and differentiating PC12 cells, a neuronotypic line used to characterize neurotoxicity. METHODS: We assessed inhibition of DNA synthesis, deficits in cell numbers and growth, oxidative stress, reduced cell viability, and shifts in differentiation toward or away from the dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh) neurotransmitter phenotypes. RESULTS: In general, the rank order of adverse effects was PFOSA {$>$} PFOS {$>$} PFBS {$\approx$} PFOA. However, superimposed on this scheme, the various agents differed in their underlying mechanisms and specific outcomes. Notably, PFOS promoted differentiation into the ACh phenotype at the expense of the DA phenotype, PFBS suppressed differentiation of both phenotypes, PFOSA enhanced differentiation of both, and PFOA had little or no effect on phenotypic specification. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that all perfluorinated chemicals are not the same in their impact on neurodevelopment and that it is unlikely that there is one simple, shared mechanism by which they all produce their effects. Our results reinforce the potential for in vitro models to aid in the rapid and cost-effective screening for comparative effects among different chemicals in the same class and in relation to known developmental neurotoxicants.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) has been associated with adverse birth outcomes, but findings of previous studies have been inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the relation of prenatal BPA exposure with intrauterine growth and evaluated the effect of the number of measurements per subject on observed associations. METHODS: This study was embedded in a Dutch population-based prospective cohort study, with urine samples collected during early, mid-, and late pregnancy. The study comprised 219 women, of whom 99 had one measurement, 40 had two measurements, and 80 had three measurements of urinary BPA. Fetal growth characteristics were repeatedly measured by ultrasound during pregnancy and combined with measurements at birth. Linear regression models for repeated measurements of both BPA and fetal growth were used to estimate associations between urinary concentrations of creatinine-based BPA (BPACB) and intrauterine growth. RESULTS: The relationship between BPACB and fetal growth was sensitive to the number of BPA measurements per woman. Among 80 women with three BPA measurements, women with BPACB {$>$} 4.22 {$\mu$}g/g crea (creatinine) had lower growth rates for fetal weight and head circumference than did women with BPACB {$<$} 1.54 {$\mu$}g/g crea, with estimated differences in mean values at birth of -683 g (20.3\% of mean) and -3.9 cm (11.5\% of mean), respectively. When fewer measurements were available per woman, the exposure-response relationship became progressively attenuated and statistically nonsignificant. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that maternal urinary BPA may impair fetal growth. Because previous studies have shown contradictory findings, further evidence is needed to corroborate these findings in the general population.},

Using RNASeq, we analyzed differential placental gene expression in cases of normal gestation, late-onset preeclampsia (LO-PE), gestational diabetes (GD) and pregnancies ending with the birth of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) or large-for-gestational-age (LGA) newborns (n\,=\,8/group). In all groups, the highest expression was detected for small noncoding RNAs and genes specifically implicated in placental function and hormonal regulation. The transcriptome of LO-PE placentas was clearly distinct, showing statistically significant (after FDR) expressional disturbances for hundreds of genes. Taqman RT-qPCR validation of 45 genes in an extended sample (n\,=\,24/group) provided concordant results. A limited number of transcription factors including LRF, SP1 and AP2 were identified as possible drivers of these changes. Notable differences were detected in differential expression signatures of LO-PE subtypes defined by the presence or absence of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). LO-PE with IUGR showed higher correlation with SGA and LO-PE without IUGR with LGA placentas. Whereas changes in placental transcriptome in SGA, LGA and GD cases were less prominent, the overall profiles of expressional disturbances overlapped among pregnancy complications providing support to shared placental responses.

Our objective was to assess the associations of maternal bisphenol urine concentrations with fetal growth measures and birth outcomes and identify potential critical exposure periods.                                         Methods               In a population-based prospective cohort study among 1379 pregnant women, we measured maternal bisphenol A, S and F urine concentrations in the first, second and third trimester. Fetal head circumference, length and weight were measured in the second and third trimester by ultrasound and at birth.                                         Results                                An interquartile range increase in maternal pregnancy-averaged bisphenol S concentrations was associated with larger fetal head circumference (difference 0.18 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.34) standard deviation scores (SDS),                 p                 -value{$<$}\,0.05) across pregnancy. When focusing on specific critical exposure periods, any detection of first trimester bisphenol S was associated with larger second and third trimester fetal head circumference (difference 0.15 (95\% CI 0.05 to 0.26) and 0.12 (95\% CI 0.02 to 0.23) SDS, respectively) and fetal weight (difference 0.12 (95\% CI 0.02 to 0.22) and 0.16 (95\% CI 0.06 to 0.26) SDS, respectively). The other bisphenols were not consistently associated with fetal growth outcomes. Any detection of bisphenol S and bisphenol F in first trimester was also associated with a lower risk of being born small size for gestational age (Odds Ratio 0.56 (95\% CI 0.38 to 0.74) and 0.55 (95\% CI 0.36 to 0.85), respectively).

  abstract = {Epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation may be a molecular mechanism through which environmental exposures affect health. Phthalates are known endocrine disruptors with ubiquitous exposures in the general population including pregnant women, and they have been linked with a number of adverse health outcomes. We examined the association between in utero phthalate exposure and altered patterns of cord blood DNA methylation in 336 Mexican-American newborns. Concentrations of 11 phthalate metabolites were analyzed in maternal urine samples collected at 13 and 26 weeks gestation as a measure of fetal exposure. DNA methylation was assessed using the Infinium HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip adjusting for cord blood cell composition. To identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that may be more informative than individual CpG sites, we used two different approaches, DMRcate and comb-p. Regional assessment by both methods identified 27 distinct DMRs, the majority of which were in relation to multiple phthalate metabolites. Most of the significant DMRs (67\%) were observed for later pregnancy (26 weeks gestation). Further, 51\% of the significant DMRs were associated with the di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolites. Five individual CpG sites were associated with phthalate metabolite concentrations after multiple comparisons adjustment (FDR), all showing hypermethylation. Genes with DMRs were involved in inflammatory response (IRAK4 and ESM1), cancer (BRCA1 and LASP1), endocrine function (CNPY1), and male fertility (IFT140, TESC, and PRDM8). These results on differential DNA methylation in newborns with prenatal phthalate exposure provide new insights and targets to explore mechanism of adverse effects of phthalates on human health.

Illumina, Inc. recently replaced the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450K) with the EPIC BeadChip, which nearly doubles the measured CpG sites to {$>$}850,000. Although the new chip uses the same underlying technology, it is important to establish if data between the two platforms are comparable within cohorts and for meta-analyses. DNA methylation was assessed by 450K and EPIC using whole blood from newborn (n = 109) and 14-year-old (n = 86) participants of the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas. The overall per-sample correlations were very high (r {$>$}0.99), although many individual CpG sites, especially those with low variance of methylation, had lower correlations (median r = 0.24). There was also a small subset of CpGs with large mean methylation {$\beta$}-value differences between platforms, in both the newborn and 14-year datasets. However, estimates of cell type proportion prediction by 450K and EPIC were highly correlated at both ages. Finally, differentially methylated positions between boys and girls replicated very well by both platforms in newborns and older children. These findings are encouraging for application of combined data from EPIC and 450K platforms for birth cohorts and other population studies. These data in children corroborate recent comparisons of the two BeadChips in adults and in cancer cell lines. However, researchers should be cautious when characterizing individual CpG sites and consider independent methods for validation of significant hits.},

We set out to compare placentae from both species across gestation, with a focus on trophoblast progenitor markers. We found that CDX2 and ELF5, but not EOMES, are expressed in early postimplantation trophoblast subpopulations in both species. Genomewide expression profiling of mouse and human placentae revealed clusters of genes with distinct co-expression patterns across gestation. Overall, there was a closer fit between patterns observed in the placentae when the inter-species comparison was restricted to human placentae through gestational week 16 (thus, excluding fullterm samples), suggesting that the developmental timeline in mouse runs parallel to the first half of human placental development. In addition, we identified VGLL1 as a human-specific marker of proliferative cytotrophoblast, where it is co-expressed with the transcription factor TEAD4. As TEAD4 is involved in trophectoderm specification in the mouse, we posit a regulatory role for VGLL1 in early events during human placental development.},

  abstract = {The family of secreted Wingless ligands plays major roles in embryonic development, stem cell maintenance, differentiation and tissue homeostasis. Accumulating evidence suggests that the canonical Wnt pathway involving nuclear recruitment of {$\beta$}-catenin and activation of Wnt-dependent transcription factors is also critically involved in development and differentiation of the diverse reproductive tissues. Here, we summarise our present knowledge about expression, regulation and function of Wnt ligands and their frizzled receptors in murine and human endometrial and placental cell types. In mice, Wnt signalling promotes early trophoblast lineage development, blastocyst activation, implantation and chorion\textendash allantois fusion. Moreover, different Wnt ligands play essential roles in the development of the murine uterine tract, in cycling endometrial cells and during decidualisation. In humans, estrogen-dependent endometrial cell proliferation, decidualisation, trophoblast attachment and invasion were shown to be controlled by the particular signalling pathway. Failures in Wnt signalling are associated with infertility, endometriosis, endometrial cancer and gestational diseases such as complete mole placentae and choriocarcinomas. However, our present knowledge is still scarce due to the complexity of the Wnt network involving numerous ligands, receptors and non-canonical pathways. Hence, much remains to be learned about the role of different Wnt signalling cascades in reproductive cell types and their changes under pathological conditions.},

  abstract = {Background We, and others, have demonstrated previously that there are differences in DNA methylation and transcript levels of a number of genes in cord blood and placenta between children conceived using assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and children conceived in vivo. The source of these differences (the effect of ART versus the underlying infertility) has never been determined in humans. In this study, we have attempted to resolve this issue by comparing placental DNA methylation levels at 37 CpG sites in 16 previously identified candidate genes in independent populations of children conceived in vivo (`fertile control' group) with ART children conceived from two groups: either autologous oocytes with infertility in one or both parents (`infertile ART' group) or donor oocytes (obtained from young fertile donors) without male infertility (`donor oocyte ART' group). Results Of the 37 CpG sites analyzed, significant differences between the three groups were found in 11 CpGs (29.73 \%), using ANOVA. Tukey's post hoc test on the significant results indicated that seven (63.63 \%) of these differences were significant between the donor oocyte ART and fertile control groups. In addition, 20 of the 37 CpGs analyzed had been identified as differentially methylated between ART and fertile control groups in an independent population in a prior study. Of these 20 CpG sites, 9 also showed significant differences in the present population. An additional 9 CpGs were found to be significantly different between the two groups. Of these 18 candidate CpGs, 12 CpGs (in seven candidate genes) also showed significant differences in placental DNA methylation levels between the donor oocyte ART and fertile control groups. Conclusions These data suggest strongly that the DNA methylation differences observed between ART and in vivo conceptions are associated with some aspect of ART protocols, not simply the underlying infertility.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A large body of evidence has shown that phthalate exposure can lower birth weight in animals and human beings. However, there are only limited data on whether phthalates could affect birth weight directly or indirectly through gestational age and pregnancy syndrome. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of prenatal exposure to phthalates on birth weight in neonates and the mediation effects of gestational age and pregnancy syndrome on the association between phthalate exposure and birth weight. METHODS: In this study, 181 mother-newborn pairs were recruited from Wenzhou city. Maternal urine samples were collected during the third trimester and measured for phthalate metabolites by ESI-MS/MS. Structural equation models (SEMs) were used to evaluate effects of phthalate on birth weight controlling for maternal education, monthly income, nutritional supplements, infant gender, and maternal weight gain per week. The potential mediated effects of phthalate exposure through gestational age and pregnancy syndrome on birth weight were also calculated by structural equation modeling. RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounders, urinary mono-phthalate levels (including MMP, MBP, MEHP, MEOHP, and MEHHP) were negatively associated with birth weight. A ten-fold increase in the concentration of MEOHP and MEHHP would be directly associated with lower birth weights (reduced to 124 g and 107 g, respectively). However, MBP had mediated effects on birth weight through gestational age, which was associated with an 85-g reduction in birth weight for every ten-fold increase in exposure. Both direct and mediated effects on birth weight were found in MMP and MEHP. The indirect effects of MMP and MEHP were mediated through gestational age and pregnancy syndrome. Thus, prenatal MMP and MEHP exposures were associated with decrease in birth weight. CONCLUSIONS: A negative association exists between prenatal phthalate exposure and birth weight in Chinese neonates. In addition to direct pathway, phthalate exposures could affect birth weight through the mediated effects of gestational age and pregnancy syndrome.},

TCS exposure has been found to cause developmental abnormalities and endocrine disruption in various species of fish. It is not clearly understood whether TCS exposure causes epigenetic alterations in developing embryos and their germ cells. In the present study, we examined the effects of TCS exposure (0, 50, 100 and, 200~{$\mu$}g/L) on embryonic development and primordial germ cells (PGCs), which are precursors of sperm and eggs, in medaka (Oyzias latipes). Developmental TCS exposure from 8~h post-fertilization through 15 days post-fertilization (dpf) resulted in several developmental abnormalities, including enlarged yolk sac, decreased head trunk angle (HTA), and severe edema in the pericardial region. The male ratio increased in the 100~{$\mu$}g/L TCS exposure group, which was negatively correlated with the expression of cyp19ala (a gene encoding aromatase) and ar{$\alpha$} (androgen receptor alpha). Developmental 50~{$\mu$}g/L TCS exposure resulted in global hypomethylation in the whole body but not in the isolated PGCs. Expression of the gene encoding DNA methyltransferases (dnmt1 and dnmt3aa) was decreased by 50~{$\mu$}g/L TCS exposure both in the whole body and PGCs. TCS altered the expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in DNA methylation and demethylation in PGCs, suggesting epigenetic effects on germ cells. The present results demonstrate that the embryos exposed to the tested concentrations of TCS develop deformities during the early life stages and that the TCS within this range possesses endocrine disrupting properties potential enough to alter sex ratios of developing embryos.},

  abstract = {Gestational Bisphenol A (BPA) exposure is associated with low birth weight. We hypothesized that the low birth weight is the consequence of reduced placental efficiency and a function of BPA-induced inflammatory, oxidative, lipotoxic, angiogenic, steroidal and fibrotic changes involving epigenetic alterations. Placentomes were collected during early (day 65) and mid (day 90) gestation (term {$\sim$}147 days) from control and BPA (gestational day 30-90)-treated pregnant sheep. BPA treatment: reduced placental efficiency and fetal weight; increased interleukin 8, lipid peroxidation marker, antioxidants, aromatase, 17 alpha-hydroxylase, estrogen receptor 2, insulin like growth factor (IGF) 2 receptor and IGF binding proteins (IGFBP), and histone deacetylase 1 and 2; reduced tumor necrosis factor alpha and IGF1 receptor at early gestation (Day 65). Gestational BPA-induced mid-gestational changes include: reduced angiogenic factor hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha; increased IL1beta, oxidative stress markers, triglyceride, 17alpha hydroxylase, IGFBP 1, DNA methyltransferase 3 A and histone deacetylase 1. These findings indicate that gestational BPA, either acting directly or by altering steroidal input, produces early/mid-gestational-specific epigenetic changes culminating in placental disruptions at several levels, in keeping with time-specific/time-lagged pregnancy-associated changes in placental efficiency and fetal weight. The reduced early-gestational placental efficiency may be a function of increased inflammation/oxidative stress and reduced IGF bioavailability with the mid-gestational restoration of placental efficiency likely driven by improved IGF bioavailability and the time-lagged response to antioxidant increase. This compensation, the result of time-lagged response to increases in negative mediators of placental function must have failed with pregnancy advancement to explain the low birthweight outcome.},

However, little is known about the occurrence of BP-type UV filters in paired maternal-fetal samples. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of eight BP-type UV filters in paired maternal-fetal samples collected from Southern China. Among target analytes, only benzophenone-3 (BP-3) was frequently (detection rate~{$>~$}80\%) detected in maternal-fetal samples, i.e., maternal serum (MS), cord serum (CS), maternal urine (MU) and amniotic fluid (AF). BP-3 was the dominant compound in MS (median: 0.14~ng/mL), CS (0.16) and AF (0.12); whereas MU was dominated by benzophenone-1 (BP-1, 2.85). The median CS/MS ratios (i.e., placental transfer rates) of 4-hydroxy benzophenone (4-OH-BP, 2.35), BP-1 (1.52), benzophenone-4 (BP-4, 1.06), and BP-3 (1.03) were higher than 1.0, suggesting that exposure levels of these chemicals in fetuses were greater than those in mothers. Significant positive correlations (r~=~0.667, p~{$<~$}0.001) of BP-3 concentrations were found between MS and CS, which suggested that MS could be an indicator of fetal exposure to BP-3. Furthermore, the CS/MS ratios of 4-OH-BP, BP-1, BP-3, and benzophenone-8 (BP-8) increased with decreasing molecular weight or log Kow. Passive diffusion may play an important role in placental transfer of these BP type UV filters. The MU/MSBP-3 ratio (5.86) was relatively higher than that of MU/MSBP-1 (0.89), which indicated that BP-3 excretes rapidly in urine. The present study documents the occurrence of eight BP-type UV filters in matched MS, CS, MU and AF samples for the first time in China.},

Matched maternal urine (MU) and amniotic fluid (AF) collected from 13 of 95 pregnant women were also analyzed to examine partition of these chemicals between maternal and fetal tissues. The placental transfer rates (PTRs; concentration ratio of parabens between CS and MS) of methyl- (MeP), ethyl- (EtP), propyl-parabens (PrP) were 0.81, 0.63, and 0.60, respectively. Furthermore, the PTRs of OH-MeP (0.93) and OH-EtP (1.8) were higher than those of their corresponding parent parabens, which suggested that hydroxylation increased placental transfer rates of parabens. Structure-dependent placental transfer mechanisms were observed. A significant negative correlation between molecular weights (or log Kow) of MeP, EtP, PrP, and p-hydroxy benzoic acid (4-HB) and PTRs suggested passive diffusion as a mechanism of placental transfer of these chemicals. Nevertheless, other hydroxylated metabolites (OH-EtP, OH-MeP, and 3,4-dihydroxy benzoic acid (3,4-DHB)) showed a positive correlation between molecular weight (or log Kow) and PTRs, which suggested that the placental transfer is mediated by protein binding of these metabolites. The MU to MS concentration ratios of MeP (MU/MSMeP) and PrP (MU/MSPrP) were 71 and 81, respectively, and MU/MSMeP was two orders of magnitude higher than that found for the metabolite (MU/MSOH-MeP: 0.35), suggesting that hydroxylation metabolite reduced urinary elimination of parabens. To our knowledge, this is the first time to report the occurrence and distribution of parabens and their metabolites in paired maternal-fetal serum, urine, and AF samples in China.

Methods We included 1490 mother-child pairs in Project Viva, a longitudinal pre-birth cohort study. We categorized prenatal acetaminophen exposure as the maximum intake (never, 1\textendash 9 or {$\geq$} 10 times) in early or mid-pregnancy, and ibuprofen intake as presence or absence in early pregnancy. We expressed intakes of antipyretics in infancy as never, 1\textendash 5, 6\textendash 10, or {$>$}10 times. We examined the associations of acetaminophen and ibuprofen (per unit increase in exposure category) during pregnancy and infancy with wheeze, asthma and allergen sensitization in early (3\textendash 5 y) (n= 1419) and mid-childhood (7\textendash 10 y) (n= 1220). Results Unadjusted models showed an elevated asthma risk in early childhood for higher infant acetaminophen (OR 1.21, 95\% CI 1.04, 1.41) and ibuprofen (OR 1.35, 95\% CI 1.19, 1.52) intake. Controlling for respiratory infections attenuated estimates for acetaminophen (OR 1.03, 95\% CI 0.88, 1.22) and ibuprofen (OR 1.19, 95\% CI 1.05, 1.36). Prenatal acetaminophen was associated with increased asthma (OR 1.26, 95\% CI 1.02, 1.58) in early but not mid-childhood. Conclusions Adjustment for respiratory infections in early life substantially diminished associations between infant antipyretics and early childhood asthma. Respiratory infections should be accounted for in studies of antipyretics and asthma, to mitigate bias due to confounding by indication.},

  abstract = {Emerging evidence suggests that early exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals has long-term consequences that can influence disease risk in offspring. During gametogenesis, imprinted genes are reasonable epigenetic targets with the ability to retain and transfer environmental messages. We hypothesized that exposures to organophosphate (OP) flame-retardants can alter DNA methylation in human sperm cells affecting offspring's health. Sperm and urine samples were collected from 67 men in North Carolina, USA. Urinary metabolites of a chlorinated OP, tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate, and two non-chlorinated OPs, triphenyl phosphate and mono-isopropylphenyl diphenyl phosphate, were measured using liquid-chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry. Sperm DNA methylation at multiple CpG sites of the regulatory differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of imprinted genes GRB10, H19, IGF2, MEG3, NDN, NNAT, PEG1/MEST, PEG3, PLAGL1, SNRPN, and SGCE/PEG10 was quantified using bisulfite pyrosequencing. Regression models were used to determine potential associations between OP concentrations and DNA methylation. We found that men with higher concentrations of urinary OP metabolites, known to originate from flame-retardants, have a slightly higher fraction of sperm cells that are aberrantly methylated. After adjusting for age, obesity-status and multiple testing, exposure to mono-isopropylphenyl diphenyl phosphate was significantly related to hypermethylation at the MEG3, NDN, SNRPN DMRs. Exposure to triphenyl phosphate was associated with hypermethylation at the GRB10 DMR; and tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate exposure was associated with altered methylation at the MEG3 and H19 DMRs. Although measured methylation differences were small, implications for public health can be substantial. Interestingly, our data indicated that a multiplicity of OPs in the human body is associated with increased DNA methylation aberrancies in sperm, compared to exposure to few OPs. Further research is required in larger study populations to determine if our findings can be generalized.},

Regression calibration is appropriate when a gold standard is available in a validation study and a linear measurement error with constant variance applies or when replicate measurements are available in a reliability study and linear random within-person error can be assumed. In this paper, the method is illustrated by correction of rate ratios describing the relations between the incidence of breast cancer and dietary intakes of vitamin A, alcohol, and total energy in the Nurses' Health Study. An example using linear regression is based on estimation of the relation between ultradistal radius bone density and dietary intakes of caffeine, calcium, and total energy in the Massachusetts Women's Health Study. Software implementing these methods uses SAS macros.},

Moreover, for the differentially methylated genes, we verified whether differences in DNA methylation corresponded to differences in mRNA transcript levels by analyzing the gene expression levels in the blood and by correlating the variation of DNA methylation values with the variation of mRNA levels of the same individuals. Finally, we examined whether the variations in DNA methylation and mRNA levels were correlated with psychopathology measurements over time.},

  abstract = {Background: Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) are persistent environmental pollutants. Toxicology studies demonstrate the potential for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and other PFCs to affect human growth and development. Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a developmental disorder with suspected environmental and genetic etiology. Objectives: We examined the cross-sectional association between serum PFC concentration and parent or self-report of doctor-diagnosed ADHD with and without current ADHD medication. Methods: We used data from the C8 Health Project, a 2005\textendash 2006 survey in a Mid-Ohio Valley community highly exposed to PFOA through contaminated drinking water, to study non-Hispanic white children 5\textendash 18 years of age. Logistic regression models were adjusted for age and sex. Results: Of the 10,546 eligible children, 12.4\% reported ADHD and 5.1\% reported ADHD plus ADHD medication use. We observed an inverted J-shaped association between PFOA and ADHD, with a small increase in prevalence for the second quartile of exposure compared with the lowest, and a decrease for the highest versus lowest quartile. The prevalence of ADHD plus medication increased with perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) levels, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.59 (95\% confidence interval, 1.21\textendash 2.08) comparing the highest quartile of exposure to the lowest. We observed a modest association between perfluorooctane sulfonate and ADHD with medication. Conclusions: The most notable finding for PFOA and ADHD, a reduction in prevalence at the highest exposure level, is unlikely to be causal, perhaps reflecting a spurious finding related to the geographic determination of PFOA exposure in this population or to unmeasured behavioral or physiologic correlates of exposure and outcome. Possible positive associations between other PFCs and ADHD, particularly PFHxS, warrant continued investigation.},

Bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates are widespread environmental contaminants and endocrine disruptors, and the placental epigenetic response to these chemicals is an area of growing research interest. Therefore, our objective was to summarize research linking BPA or phthalate exposure to placental outcomes in human pregnancies, with a particular focus on epigenetic endpoints. In PubMed, studies were selected for review (without limiting start date and ending on 1 May 2018) if they reported any direct effects of BPA or phthalates on the placenta in humans. Collectively, available studies suggest that BPA and phthalate exposures are associated with changes to placental micro-RNA expression, DNA methylation, and genomic imprinting. Furthermore, several studies suggest that fetal sex may be an important modifier of placental outcomes in response to these chemicals. Studies in humans demonstrate associations of BPA and phthalate exposure with adverse placental outcomes. Moving forward, more studies should consider sex differences (termed ``placental sex'') in the measured outcomes, and should utilize appropriate statistical approaches to assess modification by fetal sex. Furthermore, more consistent sample collection and molecular outcome assessment paradigms will be indispensable for making progress in the field. These advances, together with improved non-invasive tools for measuring placental function and outcomes across pregnancy, will be critical for understanding the mechanisms driving placental epigenetic disruption in response to BPA and phthalates, and how these disruptions translate into placental and fetal health.},

Therefore, our objectives were to (1) summarize research related to the effects BPA or phthalates on placental outcomes in animal and cell models, and (2) evaluate the challenges for using such models to study the impacts of these chemicals on placental endpoints. Overall, studies in cells and animal models suggest that BPA and phthalates impact placental hormones, some epigenetic endpoints, increase inflammation and oxidative stress, and decrease cell viability and nutrient transfer. However, few animal or cell studies have assessed these outcomes at concentrations relevant to humans. Furthermore, it is unclear whether effects of BPA/phthalates on the placenta in animal models mediate fetal outcomes, as most studies have dosed after the earliest stages of placental and fetal development. It is also unclear whether effects of these chemicals are sex-specific, as few studies have considered placental sex. Finally, while there is substantial evidence for effects of mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (the major metabolite of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate), on placental endpoints in cells, little is currently known about effects of other phthalates to which pregnant women are exposed. Moving forward, these limitations will need to be addressed to help us understand the precise mechanisms of action of these chemicals within the placenta, and how these reported perturbations impact fetal health.},

  abstract = {Most air pollution and health studies conducted in recent years have examined how a health outcome is related to pollution concentrations from a fixed outdoor monitor. The pollutant effect estimate in the health model used indicates how ambient pollution concentrations are associated with the health outcome, but not how actual exposure to ambient pollution is related to health. In this article, we propose a method of estimating personal exposures to ambient PM(2.5) (particulate matter less than 2.5 microm in diameter) using sulfate, a component of PM(2.5) that is derived primarily from ambient sources. We demonstrate how to use regression calibration in conjunction with these derived values to estimate the effects of personal ambient PM(2.5) exposure on a continuous health outcome, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)), using repeated measures data. Through simulation, we show that a confidence interval (CI) for the calibrated estimator based on large sample theory methods has an appropriate coverage rate. In an application using data from our health study involving children with moderate to severe asthma, we found that a 10 microg/m3 increase in PM(2.5) was associated with a 2.2\% decrease in FEV(1) at a 1-day lag of the pollutant (95\% CI: 0.0-4.3\% decrease). Regressing FEV(1) directly on ambient PM(2.5) concentrations from a fixed monitor yielded a much weaker estimate of 1.0\% (95\% CI: 0.0-2.0\% decrease). Relatively small amounts of personal monitor data were needed to calibrate the estimate based on fixed outdoor concentrations.},

Animal studies have given us an important opportunity to understand the mechanisms of action of many chemicals on the endocrine system and on neurodevelopment and behaviour, and to evaluate the effects of doses, time and duration of exposure. Although results are sometimes conflicting because of confounding factors, epidemiological studies in humans suggest effects of EDCs on prenatal growth, thyroid function, glucose metabolism and obesity, puberty, fertility, and on carcinogenesis mainly through epigenetic mechanisms. This manuscript reviews the reports of a multidisciplinary national meeting on this topic.},

  abstract = {Results of the analyses of occupational and environmental samples are frequently reported as ``less than a specified value,'' a practice followed by many analytical laboratories. A left-censored distribution occurs when analytical laboratories do not report results that fall below their limits of detection or quantification. Approximately 37\% of the household interior dust lead loadings collected in a large-scale, multisite, longitudinal study of lead-based paint hazard controls were reported to be below the ``method detection limit.'' These unreported values are unusable in any statistical analysis of the data and must be replaced by a valid dust lead loading estimate, a process called data imputation. This investigation tested how well data imputed using a newly formulated procedure for estimating the data below the method detection limit were correlated with dust lead loadings reported by the participating laboratories after special request. These results were also compared with those obtained by imputing the minimum detectable level by the square root of 2. Imputation of the low lead loadings was accomplished by substituting the value associated with the median percentile below each laboratory's method detection limit. A correlation of r = 0.50 was calculated between the predicted and reported dust lead loadings, with only slight bias (2.9\%) in the predicted values. An alternative imputation procedure that used the predicted value from structural equation models fit to the noncensored dust lead loadings performed about as well, although the predictions had to be ``centered'' to correspond to the censored data. An estimator that combined both of these imputation procedures only slightly improved the correlation between the predicted and laboratory values (r = 0.51). These results support the use of the new procedure rather than the commonly used imputed values of the method detection limit divided by 2 or by the square root of 2. Imputing values based on either of these common approaches may result in much more biased predictions for the censored data; in the case of these data, the dust lead loadings were overestimated by 348\%. The results also suggest that analytical laboratories should provide a numerical result for all analyzed samples, with a ``flag'' of those values below their detection limit, since these results may be more accurate than any imputed value, particularly those provided by the commonly used method of dividing the minimum detection limit by the square root of 2.},

However, the reliability of each of these measurements is not equal, and little consideration is paid to consequences for research. We correlated repeat measurements of the same DNA samples using the Illumina HumanMethylation450K and the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChips in 350 blood DNA samples. Probes that were reliably measured were more heritable and showed consistent associations with environmental exposures, gene expression, and greater cross-tissue concordance. Unreliable probes were less replicable and generated an unknown volume of false negatives. This serves as a lesson for working with DNA methylation data, but the lessons are equally applicable to working with other data: as we advance toward generating increasingly greater volumes of data, failure to document reliability risks harming reproducibility.},

Thus, our aim is to develop an approach for reconstruction of the placental methylome, which should be completely noninvasive and achieve high accuracy and resolution. Results We propose a novel size-based algorithm, FEtal MEthylome Reconstructor (FEMER), to noninvasively reconstruct the placental methylome by genomewide bisulfite sequencing and size-based analysis of maternal plasma DNA. By applying FEMER on a real clinical dataset, we demonstrate that FEMER achieves both high accuracy and resolution, thus provides a high-quality view of the placental methylome from maternal plasma DNA. FEtal MEthylome Reconstructor could also predict the DNA methylation profile of CpG islands with high accuracy, thus shows potential in monitoring of key genes involved in placental/fetal development. Source code and testing datasets for FEMER are available at http://sunlab.cpy.cuhk.edu.hk/FEMER/. Conclusion FEtal MEthylome Reconstructor could enhance the noninvasive fetal/placental methylomic analysis and facilitate its application in prenatal testing and monitoring.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia, a pregnancy complication of placental origin is associated with altered expression of angiogenic factors and their receptors. Recently, there is considerable interest in understanding the role of adverse intrauterine conditions in placental dysfunction and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Since we have observed changes in placental global DNA methylation levels in preeclampsia, this study was undertaken to examine gene promoter CpG methylation and expression of several angiogenic genes.We recruited 139 women comprising, 46 normotensive women with term delivery ({$\geq$}37 weeks), 45 women with preeclampsia delivering preterm ({$<$}37 weeks) and 48 women with preeclampsia delivering at term. Expression levels and promoter CpG methylation of VEGF, FLT-1 and KDR genes in placentae from respective groups were determined by Taqman-based quantitative real time PCR and by the Sequenom\textregistered{} EpiTYPER\texttrademark{} technology respectively. RESULTS: We observed several differentially methylated CpG sites in the promoter regions of VEGF, FLT-1 and KDR between the normotensive and preeclampsia groups. We specifically observed hypomethylated CpGs in the promoter region and an increased expression of VEGF gene between term and preterm preeclampsia. However, mean promoter CpG methylation could not account for the higher expression of FLT-1 and KDR in preterm preeclampsia as compared to normotensive group. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicates altered DNA methylation patterns in the VEGF, FLT-1 and KDR genes in preeclampsia as compared to the normotensive group, which could be involved in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia. Hypomethylation of VEGF promoter and consequent upregulation of VEGF mRNA levels could be a compensatory mechanism to restore normal angiogenesis and blood flow in preterm preeclampsia. This study suggests a role of altered DNA methylation in placental angiogenesis and in determining adverse pregnancy outcomes.},

We have previously demonstrated that maternal tobacco use is associated with alterations in promoter methylation of placental CYP1A1 and that these changes are correlated with CYP1A1 gene expression and fetal growth restriction. In this study we sought to expand our analysis of promoter methylation by correlating it to gene expression on a genome-wide scale. Employing side-by-side IlluminaHG-12 gene transcription with Infinium27K methylation arrays, we interrogated correlative changes in placental gene expression and DNA methylation associated with maternal tobacco smoke exposure at an epigenome-wide level and in consideration of signature gene pathways. We observed that the expression of 623 genes and the methylation of 1,024 CpG dinucleotides are significantly altered among smokers, with only 38 CpGs showing significant differential methylation (differing by a methylation level of {$\geq$}10\%). We identified a significant Pearson correlation ({$\geq$}0.7 or {$\leq$}-0.7) between placental transcriptional regulation and differential CpG methylation in only 25 genes among non-smokers but in 438 genes among smokers (18-fold increase, p {$<$} 0.0001), with a dominant effect among oxidative stress pathways. Differential methylation at as few as 6 sites was attributed to maternal smoking-mediated birth weight reduction in linear regression models with Bonferroni correction (p {$<$} 1.8 \texttimes{} 10-6). These studies suggest that a common perinatal exposure (such as maternal smoking) deregulates placental methylation in a CpG site-specific manner that correlates with meaningful alterations in gene expression along signature pathways.},

Furthermore, an increased popularity of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) over the past decade in women of childbearing age raises parallel concerns regarding the effects of vaporized nicotine use in pregnancy. While research using animal models which mimic tobacco smoke and nicotine exposure in pregnancy have largely replicated findings in humans, few studies focus directly on the effects of these exposures on the placenta. Because the placenta is a fetal derived tissue, and nicotine and other components of tobacco smoke are either processed by or transported directly through the placenta, such studies help us understand the risks of these exposures on the developing fetus. In this review, we summarize research on the placenta and placental-derived cells examining either tobacco smoke or nicotine exposure, including both histologic and subcellular (ie, epigenetic and molecular) modifications. Collectively, these studies reveal that tobacco and nicotine exposure are accompanied by some common and several unique molecular and epigenomic placental modifications. Consideration of the nature and sequelae of these molecular mediators of risk may help to better inform the public and more effectively curtail modifiable behavior.},

METHODS: Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood samples from 28 MZ twin pairs discordant for RA. DNA methylation was measured using the HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. Smoking, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies, and immunosuppressive treatment were included as covariates. Pathway analysis was performed using GREAT. RESULTS: Smoking was significantly associated with hypomethylation of a DMR overlapping the promoter region of the RNF5 and the AGPAT1, which are implicated in inflammation and autoimmunity, whereas DMARD treatment induced hypermethylation of the same region. Additionally, the promotor region of both S100A6 and EFCAB4B were hypomethylated, and both genes have previously been associated with RA. We replicated several candidate genes identified in a previous EWAS in treatment-na\"ive RA singletons. Gene-set analysis indicated the involvement of immunologic signatures and cancer-related pathways in RA. CONCLUSION: We identified several differentially methylated regions associated with RA, which may represent environmental effects or consequences of the disease and plausible biological pathways pertinent to the pathogenesis of RA.},

  abstract = {Heterotrimeric G-proteins mainly relay the information from G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) on the plasma membrane to the inside of cells to regulate various biochemical functions. Depending on the targeted cell types, tissues and organs, these signals modulate diverse physiological functions. The basic schemes of heterotrimeric G-proteins have been outlined. In this review we briefly summarize what is known about the regulation, signaling and physiological functions of G-proteins. We then focus on a few less explored areas such as regulation of G-proteins by non-GPCRs, and the physiological functions of G-proteins that can not be easily explained by the known G-protein signaling pathways. There are new signaling pathways and physiological functions for G-proteins to be discovered and further interrogated. With the advancements in structural and computational biological techniques, we are closer to having a better understanding of how G-proteins are regulated, and the specificity of G-protein interactions with their regulators.,},

  abstract = {STUDY HYPOTHESIS: Are the placental aquaporins (AQPs) involved in the apoptosis of human trophoblast? STUDY FINDING: The general blocking of placental AQPs with HgCl2 and, in particular, the blocking of AQP3 activity with CuSO4 abrogated the apoptotic events of human trophoblast cells. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Although apoptosis of trophoblast cells is a natural event involved in the normal development of the placenta, it is exacerbated in pathological processes, such as pre-eclampsia, where an abnormal expression and functionality of placental AQPs occur without alterations in the feto-maternal water flux. Furthermore, fluctuations in O2 tension are proposed to be a potent inducer of placental apoptotic changes and, in explants exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R), transcellular water transport mediated by AQPs was undetectable. This suggests that AQPs might be involved in processes other than water transport, such as apoptosis. STUDY DESIGN, SAMPLES/MATERIALS, METHODS: Explants from normal term placentas were maintained in culture under conditions of normoxia, hypoxia and H/R. Cell viability was determined by assessing 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide incorporation. For the general or specific inhibition of AQPs, 0.3 mM HgCl2, 5 mM CuSO4, 0.3 mM tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) or 0.5 mM phloretin were added to the culture medium before explants were exposed to each treatment. Oxidative stress parameters and apoptotic indexes were evaluated in the presence or absence of AQPs blockers. AQP3 expression was confirmed by western blot and immunohistochemistry. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: First, we observed that in H/R treatments cell viability decreased by 20.16 {$\pm$} 5.73\% compared with those explants cultured in normoxia (P = 0.009; n = 7). Hypoxia did not modify cell viability significantly. Both hypoxia and H/R conditions induced oxidative stress. Spontaneous chemiluminescence and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance levels were significantly increased in explants exposed to hypoxia (n = 6 per group, P = 0.0316 and P = 0.0009, respectively) and H/R conditions (n = 6 per group, P = 0.0281 and P = 0.0001, respectively) compared with those cultured in normoxia. Regarding apoptosis, H/R was a more potent inducer of trophoblast apoptosis than hypoxia alone. Bax expression and the number of apoptotic nuclei were significantly higher in explants cultured in H/R compared with normoxia and hypoxia conditions (n = 12, P = 0.0135 and P = 0.001, respectively). DNA fragmentation was only observed in H/R and, compared with normoxia and hypoxia, the activity of caspase-3 was highest in explants cultured in H/R (n = 12, P = 0.0001). In explants exposed to H/R, steric blocking of AQP activity with HgCl2 showed that DNA degradation was undetectable (n = 12, P = 0.001). Bax expression and caspase-3 activity were drastically reduced (n = 12, P = 0.0146 and P = 0.0001, respectively) compared with explants cultured in H/R but not treated with HgCl2. Similar results were observed in explants exposed to H/R when we blocked AQP3 activity with CuSO4. DNA degradation was undetectable and the number of apoptotic nuclei and caspase-3 activity were significantly decreased compared with explants cultured in H/R but not treated with CuSO4 (n = 12, P = 0.001 and P = 0.0001, respectively). However, TEA and phloretin treatments, to block AQP1/4 or AQP9, respectively, failed in abrogate apoptosis. In addition, we confirmed the expression and localization of AQP3 in explants exposed to H/R. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Our studies are limited by the number of experimental conditions tested, which do not fully capture the variability in oxygen levels, duration of exposure and alternating patterns of oxygen seen in vivo. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our results suggest that any alteration in placental AQP expression might disturb the equilibrium of the normal apoptotic events and may be an underlying cause in the pathophysiology of placental gestational disorders such as pre-eclampsia. Furthermore, the dysregulation of placental AQPs may be one of the crucial factors in triggering the clinical manifestations of pre-eclampsia. LARGE SCALE DATA: n/a.

  abstract = {Characterization of the ``exposome'', the set of all environmental factors that one is exposed to from conception onwards, has been advocated to better understand the role of environmental factors on chronic diseases. Here, we aimed to describe the early-life exposome. Specifically, we focused on the correlations between multiple environmental exposures, their patterns and their variability across European regions and across time (pregnancy and childhood periods). We relied on the Human Early-Life Exposome (HELIX) project, in which 87 environmental exposures during pregnancy and 122 during the childhood period (grouped in 19 exposure groups) were assessed in 1301 pregnant mothers and their children at 6\textendash 11 years in 6 European birth cohorts. Some correlations between exposures in the same exposure group reached high values above 0.8. The median correlation within exposure groups was {$>$} 0.3 for many exposure groups, reaching 0.69 for water disinfection by products in pregnancy and 0.67 for the meteorological group in childhood. Median correlations between different exposure groups rarely reached 0.3. Some correlations were driven by cohort-level associations (e.g. air pollution and chemicals). Ten principal components explained 45\% and 39\% of the total variance in the pregnancy and childhood exposome, respectively, while 65 and 90 components were required to explain 95\% of the exposome variability. Correlations between maternal (pregnancy) and childhood exposures were high ({$>$} 0.6) for most exposures modeled at the residential address (e.g. air pollution), but were much lower and even close to zero for some chemical exposures.},

Categories of urinary benzophenone-3 concentration were associated with decreased gestational age in all infants (p for trend {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.03). Between middle and low exposure groups, we also found bisphenol A was negatively associated with gestational duration (badjusted {$\frac{1}{4}$} \`A0.48 week; 95\% confidence interval: \`A0.91, \`A0.05). After stratification by gender, we found the consistent results in infant boys with those in all infants, but we did not observe significant association for girls.

  abstract = {Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are exogenous substances that interfere with the stability and regulation of the endocrine system of the body or its offspring. These substances are generally stable in chemical properties, not easy to be biodegraded, and can be enriched in organisms. In the past half century, EDCs have gradually entered the food chain, and these substances have been frequently found in maternal blood. Perinatal maternal hormone levels are unstable and vulnerable to EDCs. Some EDCs can affect embryonic development through the blood-fetal barrier and cause damage to the neuroendocrine system, liver function, and genital development. Some also effect cross-generational inheritance through epigenetic mechanisms. This article mainly elaborates the mechanism and detection methods of estrogenic endocrine disruptors, such as bisphenol A (BPA), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), diethylstilbestrol (DES) and phthalates (PAEs), and their effects on placenta and fetal health in order to raise concerns about the proper use of products containing EDCs during pregnancy and provide a reference for human health.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are xenobiotics with the ability to interfere with hormone action, even at low levels. Prior environmental epidemiology studies link numerous suspected EDCs, including phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA), to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, results for some chemicals were inconsistent and most assessed one chemical at a time. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the overall impact of prenatal exposure to an EDC mixture on neurodevelopment in school-aged children, and identify chemicals of concern while accounting for co-exposures. METHODS: Among 718 mother-child pairs from the Swedish Environmental Longitudinal, Mother and child, Asthma and allergy study (SELMA) study, we used Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression to assess the association between 26 EDCs measured in 1st trimester urine or blood, with Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (IV) Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores at age 7 years. Models were adjusted for child sex, gestational age, mother's education, mother's IQ (RAVEN), weight, and smoking status. To evaluate generalizability, we conducted repeated holdout validation, a machine learning technique. RESULTS: Using repeated holdout validation, IQ scores were 1.9-points (CI = -3.6, -0.2) lower among boys for an inter-quartile-range (IQR) change in the WQS index. BPF made the largest contribution to the index with a weight of 14\%. Other chemicals of concern and their weights included PBA (9\%), TCP (9\%), MEP (6\%), MBzP (4\%), PFOA (6\%), PFOS (5\%), PFHxS (4\%), Triclosan (5\%), and BPA (4\%). While we did observe an inverse association between EDCs and IQ among all children when training and testing the WQS index estimate on the full dataset, these results were not robust to repeated holdout validation. CONCLUSION: Among boys, early prenatal exposure to EDCs was associated with lower intellectual functioning at age 7. We identified bisphenol F as the primary chemical of concern, suggesting that the BPA replacement compound may not be any safer for children. Future studies are needed to confirm the potential neurotoxicity of replacement analogues.},

If present in excess, free copper ions can cause damage to cellular components and a delicate balance between the uptake and efflux of copper ions determines the amount of cellular copper. In biological systems, copper homeostasis has been characterized at the molecular level. It is coordinated by several proteins such as glutathione, metallothionein, Cu-transporting P-type ATPases, Menkes and Wilson proteins and by cytoplasmic transport proteins called copper chaperones to ensure that it is delivered to specific subcellular compartments and thereby to copper-requiring proteins.},

A new concept of the `developmental origins of health and disease' (DOHaD) is at stake and therefore requires a paradigm shift. Maternal obesity and malnutrition predispose offspring to develop metabolic syndrome, a vicious cycle leading to transmission to subsequent generation(s), with differences in response and susceptibility according to the sex of the individual. The placenta is a programming agent of adult health and disease. Adaptations of placental phenotype in response to maternal diet and metabolic status alter fetal nutrient supply. This implies important epigenetic changes that are, however, still poorly documented in DOHaD studies, particularly concerning overnutrition. The aim of this review is to discuss the emerging knowledge on the relationships between the effect of maternal nutrition or metabolic status on placental function and the risk of diseases later in life, with a specific focus on epigenetic mechanisms and sexual dimorphism. Explaining the sex-specific causal variables and how males versus females respond and adapt to environmental perturbations should help physicians and patients to anticipate disease susceptibility.},

The primary objective of the workshop was to identify and compare different statistical approaches and methods for analyzing complex chemical mixtures data in both simulated and real-world data sets. At the workshop, participants compared approaches and results and speculated as to why they may have differed. Several themes emerged: a) no one statistical approach appeared to outperform the others, b) many methods included some form of variable reduction or summation of the data before statistical analysis, c) the statistical approach should be selected based upon a specific hypothesis or scientific question, and d) related mixtures data should be shared among researchers to more comprehensively and accurately address methodological questions and statistical approaches. Future efforts should continue to design and optimize statistical approaches to address questions about chemical mixtures in epidemiological studies.},

Their toxicity depends on several factors including the dose, route of exposure, and chemical species, as well as the age, gender, genetics, and nutritional status of exposed individuals. Because of their high degree of toxicity, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, and mercury rank among the priority metals that are of public health significance.

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: The Illumina Infinium 450 k DNA Methylation Beadchip is a prime candidate technology for Epigenome-Wide Association Studies (EWAS). However, a difficulty associated with these beadarrays is that probes come in two different designs, characterized by widely different DNA methylation distributions and dynamic range, which may bias downstream analyses. A key statistical issue is therefore how best to adjust for the two different probe designs. RESULTS: Here we propose a novel model-based intra-array normalization strategy for 450 k data, called BMIQ (Beta MIxture Quantile dilation), to adjust the beta-values of type2 design probes into a statistical distribution characteristic of type1 probes. The strategy involves application of a three-state beta-mixture model to assign probes to methylation states, subsequent transformation of probabilities into quantiles and finally a methylation-dependent dilation transformation to preserve the monotonicity and continuity of the data. We validate our method on cell-line data, fresh frozen and paraffin-embedded tumour tissue samples and demonstrate that BMIQ compares favourably with two competing methods. Specifically, we show that BMIQ improves the robustness of the normalization procedure, reduces the technical variation and bias of type2 probe values and successfully eliminates the type1 enrichment bias caused by the lower dynamic range of type2 probes. BMIQ will be useful as a preprocessing step for any study using the Illumina Infinium 450 k platform. AVAILABILITY: BMIQ is freely available from http://code.google.com/p/bmiq/.

  abstract = {A major challenge faced by epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) is cell-type heterogeneity. As many EWAS have already demonstrated, adjusting for changes in cell-type composition can be critical when analyzing and interpreting findings from such studies. Because of their importance, a great number of different statistical algorithms, which adjust for cell-type composition, have been proposed. Some of the methods are `reference based' in that they require a priori defined reference DNA methylation profiles of cell types that are present in the tissue of interest, while other algorithms are `reference free.' At present, however, it is unclear how best to adjust for cell-type heterogeneity, as this may also largely depend on the type of tissue and phenotype being considered. Here, we provide a critical review of the major existing algorithms for correcting cell-type composition in the context of Illumina Infinium Methylation Beadarrays, with the aim of providing useful recommendations to the EWAS community.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intra-sample cellular heterogeneity presents numerous challenges to the identification of biomarkers in large Epigenome-Wide Association Studies (EWAS). While a number of reference-based deconvolution algorithms have emerged, their potential remains underexplored and a comparative evaluation of these algorithms beyond tissues such as blood is still lacking. RESULTS: Here we present a novel framework for reference-based inference, which leverages cell-type specific DNAse Hypersensitive Site (DHS) information from the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap to construct an improved reference DNA methylation database. We show that this leads to a marginal but statistically significant improvement of cell-count estimates in whole blood as well as in mixtures involving epithelial cell-types. Using this framework we compare a widely used state-of-the-art reference-based algorithm (called constrained projection) to two non-constrained approaches including CIBERSORT and a method based on robust partial correlations. We conclude that the widely-used constrained projection technique may not always be optimal. Instead, we find that the method based on robust partial correlations is generally more robust across a range of different tissue types and for realistic noise levels. We call the combined algorithm which uses DHS data and robust partial correlations for inference, EpiDISH (Epigenetic Dissection of Intra-Sample Heterogeneity). Finally, we demonstrate the added value of EpiDISH in an EWAS of smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Estimating cell-type fractions and subsequent inference in EWAS may benefit from the use of non-constrained reference-based cell-type deconvolution methods.},

  abstract = {Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) is an environmental contaminant commonly used as a plasticizer in polyvinyl chloride products. Exposure to DEHP has been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes in humans including preterm birth, low birth-weight, and pregnancy loss. Although oxidative stress is linked to the pathology of adverse pregnancy outcomes, effects of DEHP metabolites, including the active metabolite, mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), on oxidative stress responses in placental cells have not been previously evaluated. The objective of the current study is to identify MEHP-stimulated oxidative stress responses in human placental cells. We treated a human placental cell line, HTR-8/SVneo, with MEHP and then measured reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation using the dichlorofluorescein assay, oxidized thymine with mass-spectrometry, redox-sensitive gene expression with qRT-PCR, and apoptosis using a luminescence assay for caspase 3/7 activity. Treatment of HTR-8 cells with 180{$\mu$}M MEHP increased ROS generation, oxidative DNA damage, and caspase 3/7 activity, and resulted in differential expression of redox-sensitive genes. Notably, 90 and 180{$\mu$}M MEHP significantly induced mRNA expression of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), an enzyme important for synthesis of prostaglandins implicated in initiation of labor. The results from the present study are the first to demonstrate that MEHP stimulates oxidative stress responses in placental cells. Furthermore, the MEHP concentrations used were within an order of magnitude of the highest concentrations measured previously in human umbilical cord or maternal serum. The findings from the current study warrant future mechanistic studies of oxidative stress, apoptosis, and prostaglandins as molecular mediators of DEHP/MEHP-associated adverse pregnancy outcomes.},

DEHP exposure, which is widespread in the US, increases preterm birth risk; however, the mechanisms driving this relationship are unclear. Because cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) dependent prostaglandin synthesis is implicated in preterm birth, we evaluated effects of mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), the active metabolite of DEHP, on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis and COX expression in human placental macrophages (PM). In addition, responses in PM were compared to those in a human macrophage-like cell line, THP-1. METHODS: PM and THP-1 cells were treated for 2, 4, 8, or 24~h with MEHP concentrations ranging from 10 to 180 micromolar. PGE2 concentrations were assessed in culture medium using ELISA, and COX expression was determined by western blot. RESULTS: Treatment of PM and THP-1 cells with 180 micromolar MEHP for 24~h significantly increased PGE2 release. Co-treatment of PMs or THP-1 cells with 180 micromolar MEHP and the non-selective COX inhibitor indomethacin reduced MEHP-stimulated PGE2 production. Similarly, co-treatment of PM and THP-1 cells with the COX-2 selective inhibitor NS-398 resulted in a significant decrease in PGE2, suggesting that MEHP-stimulated PGE2 is dependent specifically on increased COX-2 expression. Western blot analysis revealed a significant increase in COX-2 expression in PM and THP-1 cells treated with 180 micromolar MEHP, and no changes in COX-1 expression, supporting the role of COX-2 in MEHP-stimulated PGE2 synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study are the first to demonstrate phthalate-stimulated PGE2 synthesis in PM and warrant future studies into COX-2-dependent prostaglandin synthesis as a mechanism of toxicant-associated preterm birth.},

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are one of the most ubiquitous environmental toxicants worldwide, with reported epidemiological evidence for reproductive and neurocognitive anomalies in humans. Here, we show that Aroclor 1254, a mixture of structurally distinct PCBs, causes preterm birth in interleukin (IL)-10(-/-) mice at a dose that does not show any adverse effects in wild type mice, highlighting the significance of IL-10 as an anti-toxicant cytokine. Aroclor 1254-treated IL-10(-/-) mice demonstrated increased amniotic fluid, intrauterine growth restriction, and reduced litter size with postnatal neuromotor defects. Further, our results identify aquaporin 1 (AQP1), a potent effector of fluid volume regulation and angiogenic activity, as a novel placental target of PCBs. In vivo or in vitro exposure to Aroclor 1254 coupled with IL-10 deficiency significantly reduced the protein content of AQP1. Reduced uterine AQP1 levels were associated with defective spiral artery transformation. Importantly, recombinant IL-10 reversed PCB-induced in vivo and in vitro effects. These data demonstrate for the first time that the IL-10-AQP1 axis is a novel regulator of PCB-induced in utero effects.},

  abstract = {Counter-intuitively, over-the-counter medication is commonly taken by pregnant women. In this context, acetaminophen (APAP, e.g. Paracetamol, Tylenol) is generally recommended by physicians to treat fever and pain during pregnancy. Thus, APAP ranks at the top of the list of medications taken prenatally. Insights on an increased risk for pregnancy complications such as miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth or fetal malformations upon APAP exposure are rather ambiguous. However, emerging evidence arising from human trials clearly reveals a significant correlation between APAP use during pregnancy and an increased risk for the development of asthma in children later in life. Pathways through which APAP increases this risk are still elusive. APAP can be liver toxic and since APAP appears to freely cross the placenta, therapeutic and certainly toxic doses could not only affect maternal, but also fetal hepatocytes. It is noteworthy that during fetal development, the liver transiently functions as the main hematopoietic organ. We here review the effect of APAP on metabolic and immunological parameters in pregnant women and on fetal development and immune ontogeny in order to delineate novel, putative and to date underrated pathways through which APAP use during pregnancy can impair maternal, fetal and long term children's health. We conclude that future studies are urgently needed to reconsider the safety and dosage of APAP during pregnancy and \textendash{} based on the advances made in the field of reproduction as well as APAP metabolism \textendash{} we propose pathways, which should be addressed in future research and clinical endeavors.},

Methods Participants were members of the Auckland Birthweight Collaborative Study, a longitudinal study of 871 infants of European descent sampled disproportionately for small for gestational age. Drug use during pregnancy (acetaminophen, aspirin, antacids, and antibiotics) were analysed in relation to behavioural difficulties and ADHD symptoms measured by parent report at age 7 and both parent- and child-report at 11 years of age. The analyses included multiple covariates including birthweight, socioeconomic status and antenatal maternal perceived stress. Results Acetaminophen was used by 49.8\% of the study mothers during pregnancy. We found significantly higher total difficulty scores (Strengths and Difficulty Questionnaire parent report at age 7 and child report at age 11) if acetaminophen was used during pregnancy, but there were no significant differences associated with any of the other drugs. Children of mothers who used acetaminophen during pregnancy were also at increased risk of ADHD at 7 and 11 years of age (Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised). Conclusions These findings strengthen the contention that acetaminophen exposure in pregnancy increases the risk of ADHD-like behaviours. Our study also supports earlier claims that findings are specific to acetaminophen.},

In the open field test, BPA treatment (100 microg/kg/day) increased movement in the central zone. BPA treatment (500 microg/kg/day) also increased the time spent in the open arms in the EPM test. Second, we measured cognitive ability in the Y-maze test and novel object test. BPA-treated mice showed decreased alternation behavior in the Y-maze at both of doses, indicating working memory impairment. BPA-treated mice (100 microg/kg/day) also showed decreased novel object recognition as expressed by central locomotion and frequency in the central zone, showing recognition memory impairment. Finally, to measure changes in the dopaminergic and NMDAergic systems in the brain, we performed autoradiographic receptor binding assays for dopamine D(1) and D(2) receptors, the NMDA receptor, and the dopamine transporter. BPA treatment increased D(2) receptor binding in the caudate putamen (CPu) but decreased DAT binding. BPA treatment also decreased NMDA receptor binding in the frontal cortex and CA1, CA3, and DG of the hippocampus. Taken together, our results suggest that long-term BPA exposure in mice can induce anxiolytic behaviors, cognitive deficits and changes in the dopaminergic and NMDAergic systems.},

Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation might be linked chemical exposure and spermatogenesis epigenetic reprogramming. In the present study, we investigated associations between phthalate exposures, DNA methylation and sperm quality in undergoing fertility assessment male population. Urine was used for phthalate exposures monitoring, six selected metabolites (i.e., monomethyl phthalate (MMP), monoethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) and mono (2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP)) were measured by using HPLC-MS/MS. Sperm quality parameters were determined by computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA). Sperm DNA methylation patterns (long interspersed nuclear element-1(LINE-1), H19 and LIT1) were analysed employing high-melting resolution (HRM) PCR. Urinary MMP, MEHP, MEOHP, sum of DEHP metabolites ({$\sum$}DEHP) and sum of selected phthalates metabolites ({$\sum$}PAEs) were significantly positively associated with sperm motility. Sperm LINE-1 DNA methylation were found to be negatively associated with {$\sum$}DEHP exposure and sperm quality (ejaculate volume, total sperm number and motility). Epigenetic modification LINE-1 DNA methylation demonstrated mediating effects in association between DEHP exposure and sperm motility, and 20.7\% of the association was mediated by serum LIEN-1 DNA methylation. These results extend the previous studies in association between phthalate exposures and classical semen parameters, mainly of inverse association, and sperm DNA methylation may be linked phthalate exposures and male reproductive health outcome.},

DNA methylation is a potential mechanism underlying the impacts of environmental exposures on fetal development; however, very few studies have been done elucidating the role of DNA methylation linking prenatal Se and child neurobehavior. We aimed to investigate the associations between placental Se concentration and epigenome-wide DNA methylation in two U.S. cohorts, and to assess the association between Serelated DNA methylation modifications and newborns' neurobehavior. Methods: We measured placental Se concentrations in 343 newborns enrolled in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study and in 141 newborns in the Rhode Island Child Health Study. Genome-wide placental DNA methylation was measured by HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, and newborn neurobehavioral development was assessed by the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scales (NNNS). We meta-analyzed the associations between placental Se concentration and DNA methylation in each cohort, adjusting for covariates. We also fit multiple linear regression and ordinal logistic regression for methylation and newborn NNNS summary scores. Results: We identified five Se-related differentially methylated CpG sites. Among them was cg09674502 (GFI1), where selenium concentration was positively associated with methylation ({$\beta$}-coefficient = 1.11, FDR-adjusted pvalue = 0.045), and where we observed that a one percent methylation level increase was associated with a 15\% reduced odds of higher muscle tone in the arms, legs and trunk of newborns, (OR [95\% Confidence Interval, CI] = 0.85 [0.77, 0.95]). We also observed for each interquartile range (IQR) increase in selenium concentration in the placenta, there was 1.76 times greater odds of higher hypotonicity (OR [95\% CI] = 1.76 [1.12, 2.82]). Conclusions: Placental selenium concentration was inversely associated with muscle tone of newborns, and hypermethylation of GFI1 could be a potential mechanism underlying this association.},

  abstract = {Objective Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, but its etiology remains to be elucidated. Accumulating evidence suggests that placental long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) might contribute to the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. Study Design In the present study, the expression levels of lncRNAs in human placenta were first determined by microarray analysis and then validated by secondary RT-qPCR and FISH. LncZBTB39 expression manipulation in HTR8/SVneo trophoblast cells was achieved by shRNA and plasmid transfection. Then, the invasion and migration of lncZBTB39-deficient and lncZBTB39-overexpressing trophoblast cells were evaluated by transwell assays and wound-healing assays, respectively. MMP2 activity was measured by gelatin zymography. The downstream target genes of lncZBTB39 were then identified by a transcriptomic microarray, followed by RT-qPCR validation. Results We found that lncZBTB39 was upregulated in PE-complicated human placentas, and overexpression of lncZBTB39 inhibited invasion and migration, as well as MMP2 activity in HTR8/SVneo cells, while downregulation of lncZBTB39 enhanced invasion, migration and MMP2 activity. In addition, THSD7A expression was elevated by lncZBTB39 overexpression but reduced in lncZBTB39-deficient cells; moreover, lncZBTB39 antagonized the inhibitory effects of miR-210 on THSD7A expression. Conclusion PE-complicated placentas are associated with upregulated lncZBTB39, which negatively regulates trophoblast invasion and migration, most likely by preserving the expression of THSD7A mRNA through sponging miR-210. The results of this study not only provide novel evidence that lncRNAs regulate trophoblastic activities but also suggest that lncZBTB39 may be a potential interventional target for PE.},

The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.]},

In vivo BPS exposure leads to reduced binucleate cell number in the ovine placenta. Binucleate cells form by cellular fusion, similar to the human placental syncytiotrophoblast layer. Given that human placental syncytialization can be stimulated through epidermal growth factor (EGF), we hypothesized that BPS would reduce human cytotrophoblast syncytialization through disruption of EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling.Objective:We tested whether BPS interferes EGFR signaling and disrupts human cytotrophoblast syncytialization.Methods:We first tested BPS competition for EGFR using an EGF/EGFR AlphaLISA assay. Using human primary term cytotrophoblast cells (hCTBs) and MDA-MD-231 cells, a breast cancer cell line with high EGFR expression, we evaluated EGFR downstream signaling and tested whether BPS could inhibit the EGF response by blocking EGFR activation. We also evaluated functional end points of EGFR signaling, including EGF endocytosis, cell proliferation, and syncytialization.Results:BPS blocked EGF binding in a dose-dependent manner and reduced EGF-mediated phosphorylated EGFR in both cell types. We further confirmed that BPS acted as an EGFR antagonist as shown by a reduction in EGF internalization in both hCTBs and MDA-MD-231 cells. Finally, we demonstrated that BPS interfered with EGF-mediated cell processes, such as cell proliferation in MDA-MD-231 cells and syncytialization in hCTBs. EGF-mediated, but not spontaneous, hCTB syncytialization was fully blocked by BPS (200\,ng/mL200\,ng/mL{$<$}math alttext="200 nanograms per milliliter" display="inline" id="i1"{$><$}mrow{$><$}mn{$>$}200{$<$}/mn{$><$}mtext{$>$}\,ng{$<$}/mtext{$><$}mo{$>$}/{$<$}/mo{$><$}mi mathvariant="normal"{$>$}mL{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}), a dose within urinary BPS concentrations detected in humans.Conclusions:Given the role of EGFR in trophoblast proliferation and differentiation during placental development, this study suggests that exposures to BPS at environmentally relevant concentrations may result in placenta dysfunction, affecting fetal growth and development.  https://doi-org.proxy.insermbiblio.inist.fr/10.1289/EHP7297},

Perturbations of placental structure and function have been associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes later in life. Placental CpG methylation represents an epigenetic modification with the potential to impact placental function, fetal development and child health later in life. Study design Genome-wide placental CpG methylation levels were compared between spontaneous versus indicated deliveries from extremely preterm births (EPTBs) (n = 84). The association between the identified differentially methylated CpG sites and neurocognitive outcome at ten years of age was then evaluated. Results Spontaneous EPTB was associated with differential CpG methylation levels in 250 CpG sites (217 unique genes) with the majority displaying hypermethylation. The identified genes are known to play a role in neurodevelopment and are enriched for basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor binding sites. The placental CpG methylation levels for 17 of these sites predicted cognitive function at ten years of age. Conclusion A hypermethylation signature is present in DNA from placentas in infants with spontaneous EPTB. CpG methylation levels of critical neurodevelopment genes in the placenta predicted later life cognitive function, supporting the developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis (DOHaD).},

Causal mediation analysis is frequently used to assess potential causal mechanisms. The mediation package implements a comprehensive suite of statistical tools for conducting such an analysis. The package is organized into two distinct approaches. Using the model-based approach, researchers can estimate causal mediation effects and conduct sensitivity analysis under the standard research design. Furthermore, the design-based approach provides several analysis tools that are applicable under different experimental designs. This approach requires weaker assumptions than the model-based approach. We also implement a statistical method for dealing with multiple (causally dependent) mediators, which are often encountered in practice. Finally, the package also offers a methodology for assessing causal mediation in the presence of treatment noncompliance, a common problem in randomized trials.},

DNA methylation (DNAm) can be used as a biomarker of cell types, and through deconvolution approaches, to infer underlying cell type proportions. Cell-type deconvolution algorithms have two main categories: reference-based and reference-free. Reference-based algorithms are supervised methods that determine the underlying composition of cell types within a sample by leveraging differentially methylated regions (DMRs) specific to cell type, identified from DNAm measures of purified cell populations. Reference-free algorithms are unsupervised methods for use when celltype specific DMRs are not available, allowing scientists to estimate putative cellular proportions or control for potential confounding from cell type. Reference-based deconvolution is typically applied to blood samples and has potentiated our understanding of the relation between immune profiles and disease by allowing estimation of immune cell proportions from archival DNA. Bioinformatic analyses using DNAm to infer immune cell proportions, part of a new field known as Immunomethylomics, provides a new direction for consideration in epigenome wide association studies (EWAS).},

These regions were consistently differentially methylated in every subtype and all implicated genes are localized on chromosome 1p36.3. We also validated seventeen DMGRs in an independent data set. Identification and validation of shared DNAm alterations across tumor subtypes in early stage tumors advances our understanding of common biology underlying breast carcinogenesis and may contribute to biomarker development.

  abstract = {Prenatal famine in humans has been associated with various later-life consequences, depending on the gestational timing of the insult and the sex of the exposed individual. Epigenetic mechanisms have been proposed to underlie these associations. Indeed, animal studies and our early human data on the imprinted IGF2 locus indicated a link between prenatal nutritional and DNA methylation. However, it remains unclear how common changes in DNA methylation are and whether they are sex- and timing-specific paralleling the later-life consequences of prenatal famine exposure. To this end, we investigated the methylation of 15 loci implicated in growth and metabolic disease in individuals who were prenatally exposed to a war-time famine in 1944\textendash 45. Methylation of INSIGF was lower among individuals who were periconceptionally exposed to the famine (n = 60) compared with their unexposed same-sex siblings (P = 2 \texttimes{} 10-5), whereas methylation of IL10, LEP, ABCA1, GNASAS and MEG3 was higher (all P {$<$} 10-3). A significant interaction with sex was observed for INSIGF, LEP and GNASAS. Next, methylation of eight representative loci was compared between 62 individuals exposed late in gestation and their unexposed siblings. Methylation was different for GNASAS (P = 1.1 \texttimes{} 10-7) and, in men, LEP (P = 0.017). Our data indicate that persistent changes in DNA methylation may be a common consequence of prenatal famine exposure and that these changes depend on the sex of the exposed individual and the gestational timing of the exposure.},

  abstract = {Being born small for gestational age (SGA), a proxy for intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and prenatal famine exposure are both associated with a greater risk of metabolic disease. Both associations have been hypothesized to involve epigenetic mechanisms. We investigated whether prenatal growth restriction early in pregnancy was associated with changes in DNA methylation at loci that were previously shown to be sensitive to early gestational famine exposure. We compared 38 individuals born preterm ({$<$}32 weeks) and with a birth weight too low for their gestational age (less than -1SDS; SGA) with 75 individuals born preterm but with a birth weight appropriate for their gestational age (greater than -1SDS) and a normal postnatal growth (greater than -1SDS at three months post term; AGA). The SGA individuals were not only lighter at birth, but also had a smaller length (p = 3.3 \texttimes{} 10-13) and head circumference at birth (p = 4.1 \texttimes{} 10-13). The DNA methylation levels of IGF2, GNASAS, INSIGF and LEP were 48.5, 47.5, 79.4 and 25.7\% respectively. This was not significantly different between SGA and AGA individuals. Risk factors for being born SGA, including preeclampsia and maternal smoking, were also not associated with DNA methylation at these loci. Growth restriction early in development is not associated with DNA methylation at loci shown to be affected by prenatal famine exposure. Our and previous results by others indicate that prenatal growth restriction and famine exposure may be associated with different epigenetic changes or non-epigenetic mechanisms that may lead to similar later health outcomes.},

  abstract = {A narrative review of risks of acetaminophen to the fetus is conducted. Prenatal exposure to acetaminophen is associated with cerebral palsy, autism spectrum disorder, communication problems, hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, attention and executive function problems, language delay, lower intelligence quotient, behavioral problems, shorter anogenital distance in male infants, decreased relative numbers of hematopoietic stem cells in cord blood, wheeze, and asthma. Paternal preconception acetaminophen use for 8 day or more is associated with ADHD. A systematic review and meta-analysis showed significant association between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and child asthma risk. Exposure for 29 day or more is probably danger. However, we cannot assert that exposure for 28 day or less is safe. At the present moment, any public organizations or academic associations have not declared the danger of acetaminophen in pregnancy. Each article has poor power to show risks of acetaminophen, however, the integration of the articles that showed adverse effects of acetaminophen may have power to show them. We should recognize that acetaminophen is danger in pregnancy. However, acetaminophen is the safest medicine as analgesics for nociceptive pain and antipyretics in childhood and pregnancy. Fever and pain during pregnancy themselves are probably associated with adverse gestational outcomes. Acetaminophen should be used at the lowest effective dosage and for the shortest time. We should use acetaminophen in pregnancy only when needed and no safer option for pain or fever relief is available. I would like public organizations or academic associations to declare danger (or safety) of acetaminophen in pregnancy.},

Objectives: We assessed the associations between exposure to phthalate metabolites and pregnancy loss. Methods: Using a previously established cohort of couples planning their first pregnancy, we analyzed four primary and two oxidized secondary phthalate metabolites in urine samples collected on day 10 after the first day of the last menstrual period before conception occurred (n = 128) and during the previous cycle (if any, n = 111). Subclinical embryonal loss was identified by repeated measurement of urinary human chorionic gonadotropin, and information on clinical spontaneous abortions was obtained by telephone interview with the mother. Results: Pregnancy loss (n = 48) was increased among women with urinary concentration of monoethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) in the upper tertile in the conception sample compared with women in the lowest tertile [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.9; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.1, 7.6]. The corresponding OR for subclinical embryonal loss (n = 32) was 40.7 (95\% CI: 4.5, 369.5). Conclusions: The phthalate metabolite MEHP was associated with higher occurrence of pregnancy loss. Because this is the first human study to show this association and the sample size is small, the findings need to be corroborated in independent studies.},

  abstract = {Mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), one of the main metabolites of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), exerted embryo/fetotoxic effects similar to those of DEHP at lower doses. Oral administration of MEHP (1 mL/kg) to the mice of 8 days gestation resulted in less than 32\% of live fetuses, all of which were deformed. When DEHP (10 mL/kg) was given to the pregnant mice of 8 days gestation, approximately 0.03\% and 0.003\% of the administered dose was found in fetuses as DEHP and MEHP, respectively, after 12 hr. The presence of the MEHP in fetuses is probably due to the transplacental crossing of the MEHP formed in the maternal body, since the fetuses of mice up to day 9 of pregnancy showed no hydrolytic activity of DEHP to MEHP. Crossing of MEHP through the placenta was proven by an experiment in which MEHP was administered in pregnant mice. A single injection of MEHP (25 or 50 mg/kg), but not DEHP (500 mg/kg) into pregnant mice, induced a significantly high incidence of somatic mutations in the coat hair of offspring of mice (KYG, female X PW, male; C57BL/6Crj, female X PW, male). All these data suggest that MEHP could be responsible for the embryotoxic/fetotoxic effects observed with DEHP.},

OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to assess the prenatal DDE exposure window and its effect on the psychomotor development index (PDI) and mental development index (MDI) during the first year of life. METHODS: We recruited 244 children whose pregnancies and deliveries were uncomplicated, and whose mothers were monitored throughout the pregnancy. Participating mothers were not occupationally exposed to DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) but were residents of a zone in Mexico with endemic malaria. We measured serum levels of DDE before pregnancy and during each trimester of the pregnancy. We evaluated PDI and MDI of the Bayley Scales for Infant Development (BSID-II), at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months of age. We adjusted for quality of the home environment and maternal intellectual coefficient (IQ). We used generalized mixed-effects models for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Third-trimester DDE level (7.8 +/- 2.8 ppb) was significantly higher than the level at baseline, first, and second trimesters, but the differences never exceeded 20\%. Only DDE levels during the first trimester of pregnancy were associated with a significant reduction in PDI (every doubled increase of DDE level reduced the PDI 0.5 points). DDE was not associated with MDI. CONCLUSIONS: A critical window of exposure to DDE in utero may be the first trimester of the pregnancy, and psychomotor development is a target of this compound. Residues of DDT metabolites may present a risk of developmental delay for years after termination of DDT use.},

The most common paraben found in consumer products is methylparaben. To date, no study has examined whether these substances cross the human placenta. A total of 100 study subjects (50 mother-child pairs) were enrolled at two medical institutions, serving primarily African-American and Caucasian women, respectively. A maternal blood sample was drawn on admission and a paired cord blood sample was obtained at delivery. Of the 50 mothers, 47 (94\%) showed methylparaben in their blood (mean level 20.41\,ng/l), and 47 in cords bloods (mean level 36.54\,ng/l). There were 45 mother-child pairs where methylparaben was found in both samples. Of these, the fetal level was higher than the maternal level in 23 (51\%). For butylparaben, only 4 mothers (8\%) showed detectable levels (mean 40.54\,ng/l), whereas 8 cord blood samples (16\%) were positive (mean 32.5\,ng/l). African-American mothers and infants showed higher prevalence of detectable levels (P=0.017). Methylparaben and butylparaben demonstrate transplacental passage. Additional studies are needed to examine potential differences in exposure by geography and demographics, what products are used by pregnant women that contain these preservatives, as well as any potential long-term effects in the growth and development of exposed children.},

However, these findings may be confounded by unmeasured factors related to maternal use of paracetamol and child outcomes. Objective To examine the association between duration and timing of prenatal paracetamol exposure on parent-reported communication skills, behaviour, and temperament in preschool-aged children, with focus on the role of unmeasured confounding. Methods We used data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. Linear and generalised linear models with inverse probability weights and robust standard errors were used to quantify the association between prenatal paracetamol exposure and continuous and categorical outcomes. Results Of the 32 934 children included in our study, 8374 (25.4\%), 4961 (15.1\%), and 1791 (5.4\%) were prenatally exposed to paracetamol in one, two, and three trimesters, respectively. Children exposed to paracetamol in two trimesters scored lower on shyness compared with unexposed children ({$\beta$} -0.62, 95\% confidence interval [CI] -1.05, -0.19). Children exposed to paracetamol in three trimesters had a moderate increased risk of internalising behaviour problems (relative risk (RR) 1.36, 95\% CI 1.02, 1.80) and borderline externalising behaviour problems (RR 1.22, 95\% CI 0.93, 1.60) compared with unexposed children. Children exposed to paracetamol in 2nd/3rd trimester scored lower on shyness ({$\beta$} -0.32, 95\% CI -0.66, 0.02) compared with unexposed children. Sensitivity analyses indicated that unmeasured confounders play an important role and may potentially bias the effect estimates away from the null. Conclusions Timing of exposure and short-term use of paracetamol during pregnancy do not seem to pose any substantial risk of the outcomes examined. Although we found an association between paracetamol use in multiple trimesters and lower shyness and greater internalising behaviour in preschool-aged children, we cannot rule out chance or unmeasured confounding as possible explanations for these findings.},

Real-time PCR was performed to quantify RASSF1A concentrations before and after methylation-sensitive restriction digestion in a duplex assay, where ss-actin concentrations were quantified as an internal control to confirm complete enzyme digestion. RESULTS: The median concentrations of hypermethylated RASSF1A were 4.3-fold higher in maternal plasma of pre-eclamptic subjects than in controls. There was no significant difference between the extent of RASSF1A hypermethylation in placental tissues obtained from pre-eclamptic and control pregnancies.

  abstract = {Imprinted genes are expressed primarily from one parental allele by virtue of a germ line epigenetic process. Achaete-scute complex homolog 2 (Ascl2 aka Mash2) is a maternally expressed imprinted gene that plays a key role in placental and intestinal development. Loss-of-function of Ascl2 results in an expansion of the parietal trophoblast giant cell (P-TGC) lineage, an almost complete loss of Trophoblast specific protein alpha (Tpbpa) positive cells in the ectoplacental cone and embryonic failure by E10.5. Tpbpa expression marks the progenitors of some P-TGCs, two additional trophoblast giant cell lineages (spiral artery and canal), the spongiotrophoblast and the glycogen cell lineage. Using a transgenic model, here we show that elevated expression of Ascl2 reduced the number of P-TGC cells by 40\%. Elevated Ascl2 also resulted in a marked loss of the spongiotrophoblast and a substantial mislocalisation of glycogen cells into the labyrinth. In addition, Ascl2-Tg placenta contained considerably more placental glycogen than wild type. Glycogen cells are normally located within the junctional zone in close contact with spongiotrophoblast cells, before migrating through the P-TGC layer into the maternal decidua late in gestation where their stores of glycogen are released. The failure of glycogen cells to release their stores of glycogen may explain both the inappropriate accumulation of glycogen and fetal growth restriction observed late in gestation in this model. In addition, using in a genetic cross we provide evidence that Ascl2 requires the activity of a second maternally expressed imprinted gene, Pleckstrin homology-like domain, family a, member 2 (Phlda2) to limit the expansion of the spongiotrophoblast. This "belts and braces" approach demonstrates the importance of genomic imprinting in regulating the size of the placental endocrine compartment for optimal placental development and fetal growth.},

The tissue-specific paternal silencing of Gs{$\alpha$} results in different parent-of-origin specific phenotypes in patients who carry inactivating GNAS mutations.

  abstract = {The GNAS complex locus encodes the alpha-subunit of the stimulatory G protein (Gs{$\alpha$}), a ubiquitous signaling protein mediating the actions of many hormones, neurotransmitters, and paracrine/aurocrine factors via generation of the second messenger cAMP. GNAS gives rise to other gene products, most of which exhibit exclusively monoallelic expression. In contrast, Gs{$\alpha$} is expressed biallelically in most tissues; however, paternal Gs{$\alpha$} expression is silenced in a small number of tissues through as-yet-poorly understood mechanisms that involve differential methylation within GNAS. Gs{$\alpha$}-coding GNAS mutations that lead to diminished Gs{$\alpha$} expression and/or function result in Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO) with or without hormone resistance, i.e. pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia/Ic and pseudo-pseudohypoparathryodism, respectively. Microdeletions that alter GNAS methylation and, thereby, diminish Gs{$\alpha$} expression in tissues in which the paternal Gs{$\alpha$} allele is normally silenced also cause hormone resistance, which occurs typically in the absence of AHO, a disorder termed pseudohypoparathyroidism typeIb. Mutations of GNAS that cause constitutive Gs{$\alpha$} signaling are found in patients with McCuneAlbright syndrome, fibrous dysplasia of bone, and different endocrine and non-endocrine tumors. Clinical features of these diseases depend significantly on the parental allelic origin of the GNAS mutation, reflecting the tissue-specific paternal Gs{$\alpha$} silencing. In this article, we review the pathogenesis and the phenotypes of these human diseases.},

Mutations, epimutations, and uniparental disomies affecting imprinted loci cause placental stunting or overgrowth in mice and humans, and placental neoplasms (complete hydatidiform moles) are androgenetic. Whether imprinted genes might also play a role in the more common medical conditions that affect the placenta, including preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), is an important question that is now receiving some attention.

  abstract = {Background: Persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and pesticides bioaccumulate through the food chain and cross the placenta. POPs are developmental toxicants in animals but the epidemiological evidence on pregnancy outcomes is inconsistent. Maternal gestational weight gain has been recently suggested as a key factor explaining the association between PCBs with lower birth weight. Aims: We examined whether in utero exposure to current low levels of different POPs is associated with fetal growth and gestational age in a mother\textendash child cohort in Crete, Greece (Rhea study), and evaluated specifically whether maternal gestational weight gain may affect this association. Methods: We included 1117 mothers and their newborns from the Rhea study. Mothers were interviewed and blood samples collected during the first trimester of pregnancy. Information on birth outcomes was retrieved from medical records. Concentrations of several PCBs, other organochlorine compounds (dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethene [DDE], dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane [DDT] and hexachlorobenzene [HCB]) and one polybrominated diphenyl ether congener (tetra-bromodiphenyl ether [BDE-47]), were determined in maternal serum by triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. Multiple linear regression models were used to investigate the associations of birth weight, gestational age, and head circumference with each compound individually on the log10 scale, and with combined exposures through the development of an exposure score. Results: In multivariate models, birth weight was negatively associated with increasing levels of HCB ({$\beta$} = - 161.1 g; 95\% CI: - 296.6, - 25.7) and PCBs ({$\beta$} = -174.1 g; 95\% CI: - 332.4, - 15.9); after further adjustment for gestational weight gain these estimates were slightly reduced ({$\beta$} = -154.3 g; 95\% CI: -300.8, -7.9 for HCB and {$\beta$} = -135.7 g; 95\% CI: -315.4, 43.9 for PCBs). Furthermore, in stratified analysis, the association between POPs and birth weight was only observed in women with inadequate or excessive gestational weight gain. Small, negative associations were observed with head circumference while no association was observed with gestational age. Conclusions: The findings suggest that prenatal exposure to PCBs and HCB impairs fetal growth and adds to the growing literature that demonstrates an association between low-level environmental pollutant exposure and fetal growth. Furthermore our results suggest that the association of POPs, maternal gestational weight gain and birth weight is probably more complex than that previously hypothesized.},

  abstract = {Cytosine methylation in CpG dinucleotides is believed to be important in gene regulation, and is generally associated with reduced levels of transcription. Methylation-mediated gene silencing involves a series of DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions that begins with the binding of methyl-CpG binding proteins (MBPs) followed by the recruitment of histone-modifying enzymes that together promote chromatin condensation and inactivation. It is widely known that alterations in methylation patterns, and associated gene activities, are often found in human tumors. However, the mechanisms by which methylation patterns are altered are not currently understood. In this paper, we investigate the impact of oxidative damage to a methyl-CpG site on MBP binding by the selective placement of 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (HmC) in a MBP recognition sequence. Duplexes containing these specific modifications were assayed for binding to the methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) of one member of the MBP family, methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Our results reveal that oxidation of either a single guanine to 8-oxoG or of a single 5mC to HmC, significantly inhibits binding of the MBD to the oligonucleotide duplex, reducing the binding affinity by at least an order of magnitude. Oxidative damage to DNA could therefore result in heritable, epigenetic changes in chromatin organization.},

Several studies highlight their widespread environmental occurrence and endocrine disrupting effects. However, little is known about human exposure to these compounds. The objective of this study was to investigate the exposure of human embryos and foetuses to endocrine disrupting UV filters and PBs. Placentas from volunteer mothers in Barcelona were collected at delivery after informed, written consent by the pregnant women. UV filters and parabens were analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The excellent performance of the method allowed measuring the target compounds in human placental tissue at low ng/g fresh weight level. The detection frequency of the selected compounds was in the range 17-100\%. Benzophenone-1, methyl paraben, butyl paraben and benzyl paraben were detected in all samples. The highest measured concentration corresponded to methyl paraben, 11.77ng/g fresh weight. Reported concentrations of benzophenone-4 and benzyl paraben constitute the first evidence about their accumulation in placenta. The results obtained corroborate that foetuses are exposed to a wide diversity of UV filters and PBs via the placenta.},

We evaluated in Spanish pregnant women (n=391) the reproducibility of urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations and predictors of exposure. We measured mono-(4-methyl-7-hydroxyoctyl) phthalate (7-OHMMeOP), mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP), mono-(2-carboxyhexyl) phthalate (MCMHP), mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP), mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-iso-butyl phthalate (MiBP) and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) in two spot urine samples collected in the first and third pregnancy trimesters. Questionnaires on predictors and food-frequency questionnaires were administered in the first and/or third pregnancy trimesters. Using creatinine-adjusted phthalate metabolite concentrations (log10-trasformed) we calculated intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Linear mixed and regression models assessed the associations between predictors and phthalate metabolites. The ICCs ranged from 0.24 to 0.07 and were higher for MBzP, MEP, MiBP, and lower for MEOHP and MEHHP. Overweight, lower education and social class, and less frequent consumption of organic food were associated with higher levels of some phthalate metabolites. The use of household cleaning products (bleach, ammonia, glass cleaners, oven cleaning sprays and degreasing products) at least once per week during pregnancy was associated with 10-44\% higher urinary phthalate metabolites. Bottled-water consumption, consumption of food groups usually stored in plastic containers or cans, use of plastic containers for heating food and cosmetic use were not associated with increased concentrations of phthalate metabolites. This large study with repeated phthalate measurements suggests that, in this Spanish setting, sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and household cleaning product use are better predictors of phthalate exposure levels in pregnant women than average water and food consumption and use of plastic containers and cosmetics.},

This article documents mice 2.9, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice 2.9, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice 2.9 adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice 2.9 can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network.

  abstract = {Background: Prenatal exposure to organophosphate (OP) pesticides has been associated with altered neuronal cell development and behavioral changes in animal offspring. However, the few studies investigating the association between prenatal OP pesticide exposure and neurodevelopmental outcomes such as Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and autistic traits in children produced mixed findings. Objective: The objective of the present study was to examine whether maternal urinary concentrations of OP pesticide metabolites are associated with ADHD and autistic traits in children participating in the Generation R Study, a population-based birth cohort from Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Method: Maternal concentrations of 6 dialkylphosphates (DAPs) were measured using gas chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry in urine samples collected at {$<$} 18 weeks, 18-25 weeks, and {$>$} 25 weeks of gestation in 784 mother-child pairs. DAP metabolite concentrations were expressed as molar concentrations divided by creatinine levels and log10 transformed. ADHD traits were measured at ages 3, 6, and 10 years using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (n = 781) and autistic traits were measured at age 6 years using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) (n = 622). First, regression models were fit for the averaged prenatal exposure across pregnancy. Second, we investigated associations for each collection phase separately, and applied a mutually adjusted model in which the effect of prenatal DAP concentrations from each time period on ADHD and autistic traits were jointly estimated. All associations were adjusted for relevant confounders. Results: Median DAP metabolite concentration was 309 nmol/g creatinine at {$<$} 18 weeks, 316 nmol/g creatinine at 18\textendash 25 weeks, and 308 nmol/g creatinine at {$>$} 25 weeks of gestation. Overall, DAP metabolite concentrations were not associated with ADHD traits. For instance, a log10 increase in averaged total DAP concentrations across gestation was not associated with a lower ADHD score (-0.03 per SD 95 CI: -0.28 to 0.23). Similarly, no associations between maternal DAP concentrations and autistic traits were detected. Conclusions: In this study of maternal urinary DAP metabolite concentrations during pregnancy, we did not observe associations with ADHD and autistic traits in children. These are important null observations because of the relatively high background DAP concentrations across pregnancy, the relatively large sample size, and the 10-year follow-up of the offspring. Given the measurement error inherent in our OP pesticide exposure},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to organophosphate (OP) pesticides associate with impaired neurodevelopment in humans and animal models. However, much uncertainty exists about the brain structural alterations underlying these associations. The objective of this study was to determine whether maternal OP pesticide metabolite concentrations in urine repeatedly measured during gestation are associated with brain morphology and white matter microstructure in 518 preadolescents aged 9-12 years. METHOD: Data came from 518 mother-child pairs participating in the Generation R Study, a population-based birth cohort from Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Maternal urine concentrations were determined for 6 dialkylphosphates (DAPs) including 3 dimethyl (DM) and 3 diethyl (DE) alkyl phosphate metabolites, collected at early, mid, and late pregnancy. At child's age 9-12 years, magnetic resonance imaging was performed to obtain T1-weighted images for brain volumes and surface-based cortical thickness and cortical~surface area, and diffusion tensor imaging was used to measure white matter microstructure through fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Linear regression models were fit for the averaged prenatal exposure across pregnancy. RESULTS: DM and DE metabolite concentrations were not associated with brain volumes, cortical thickness, and cortical surface area. However, a 10-fold increase in averaged DM metabolite concentrations across pregnancy was associated with lower FA (B~=~-1.00, 95\%CI~=~-1.80, -0.20) and higher MD (B~=~0.13, 95\%CI~=~0.04, 0.21). Similar associations were observed for DE concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence that OP pesticides may alter normal white matter microstructure in children, which could have consequences for normal neurodevelopment. No associations were observed with structural brain morphology, including brain volumes, cortical thickness, and cortical surface area.},

Notions of direct and indirect effects from a counterfactual approach to mediation are compared with those arising from the standard regression approach to mediation of Baron and Kenny (1986), commonly utilized in the social science literature.

A number of conceptual issues are discussed concerning the interpretation of identification conditions for mediation, the notion of counterfactuals based on hypothetical interventions and the so called consistency and composition assumptions.},

In this paper, these approaches from causal inference are further extended to settings in which multiple mediators may be of interest. Two analytic approaches, one based on regression and one based on weighting are proposed to estimate the effect mediated through multiple mediators and the effects through other pathways. The approaches proposed here accommodate exposuremediator interactions and, to a certain extent, mediator-mediator interactions as well. The methods handle binary or continuous mediators and binary, continuous or count outcomes. When the mediators affect one another, the strategy of trying to assess direct and indirect effects one mediator at a time will in general fail; the approach given in this paper can still be used. A characterization is moreover given as to when the sum of the mediated effects for multiple mediators considered separately will be equal to the mediated effect of all of the mediators considered jointly. The approach proposed in this paper is robust to unmeasured common causes of two or more mediators.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported associations between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms and DNA methylation in children. We report the first epigenome-wide association study meta-analysis of adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms, based on peripheral blood DNA methylation (Infinium HumanMethylation450K array) in three population-based adult cohorts. METHODS: An epigenome-wide association study was performed in the Netherlands Twin Register (N = 2258, mean age 37 years), Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (N = 800, age 38 years), and Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin Study (N = 1631, age 18 years), and results were combined through meta-analysis (total sample size N = 4689). Region-based analyses accounting for the correlation between nearby methylation sites were also performed. RESULTS: One epigenome-wide significant differentially methylated position was detected in the Dunedin study, but meta-analysis did not detect differentially methylated positions that were robustly associated across cohorts. In region-based analyses, six significant differentially methylation regions (DMRs) were identified in the Netherlands Twin Register, 19 in the Dunedin study, and none in the Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin Study. Of these DMRs, 92\% were associated with methylation quantitative trait loci, and 68\% showed moderate to large bloodbrain correlations for DNA methylation levels. DMRs included six nonoverlapping DMRs (three in the Netherlands Twin Register, three in the Dunedin study) in the major histocompatibility complex, which were associated with expression of genes in the major histocompatibility complex, including C4A and C4B, previously implicated in schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings point at new candidate loci involved in immune and neuronal functions that await further replication. Our work also illustrates the need for further research to examine to what extent epigenetic associations with psychiatric traits depend on characteristics such as age, comorbidities, exposures, and genetic background.},

After a short sample preparation time the extracts are analysed by UHPLC-MS/MS using negative electrospray ionization. Labeled internal standards and matrix-matched calibration are used for quantification of the compounds. The method was validated according FDA guideline for bio analytical methods using spiked samples at three concentration levels (0.5-5 and 25 ng g-1). The parameters accuracy and precision fulfill the criteria. Calibration curves are linear between 0.5 and 50 ng -1. The limits of detection and quantification are in the range of 0.1-0.3 ng g-1 and 0.2-0.7 ng g-1, respectively. The applicability of the method was demonstrated on 71 human placenta samples from a Belgian cohort. The detection frequency was highest for OP (95\%), EtP (86\%), BPA (49\%) and BPS (44\%). Among the quantified compounds the highest quantification frequency was observed for OP (85\%), EtP (65\%) and BPA (25\%). The concentrations of parabens ranged from 0.5 to 7.1 ng g-1 for MeP, from 0.5 to 4.5 ng g-1 for EtP and from 0.5 to 9.1 ng g-1 for PrP. The levels of bisphenols ranged from 0.5 to 3.9 ng g-1 for BPA, from 0.6 to 2.1 ng g-1 for BPF and from 0.8 to 1.3 ng g-1 for BPS. BPB and NP were not detected and OP levels ranged from 0.5 to 3.7 ng g g-1. The results demonstrate that the developed analytical method is very sensitive and that levels of several compounds with known /suspected endocrine disrupting properties could be detected or quantified in human placenta samples. The results therefore suggest that fetal exposure to these compounds occurs. The method will be useful for studies to evaluate the health effects associated with this prenatal exposure.},

Multiple antiandrogenic phthalates exposure during fetal development can have greater impacts than individual exposure; thus, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) recommends them for cumulative assessment. Using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data (NHANES, 2001-2012), we developed a potency-weighted sum of daily intake ({$\sum$}androgen-disruptor; {$\mu$}g/kg/day) of di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBzP), and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) based on NAS recommendations, and included diethyl phthalate (DEP) and diisononyl phthalate (DiNP) in additional metrics (2005-2012). We compared racial/ethnic differences in {$\sum$}androgen-disruptor among 2842 reproductive-aged women. In sensitivity analyses, we assessed the influence of potency assumptions, alternate urine dilution adjustment methods, and weighting phthalate metabolites directly rather than daily intake estimates of parent compounds. We found that DEHP contributed most to {$\sum$}androgen-disruptor (48-64\%), and that {$\sum$}androgen-disruptor decreased over time. Black women generally had higher cumulative exposures than white women, although the magnitude and precision of the difference varied by model specification. Our approach provides a blueprint for combining chemical exposures linked to common adverse outcomes, and should be considered in future exposure, risk, and epidemiological studies.},

The aim of the study was to evaluate the relationship between prenatal exposure to BPA and birth and gestational outcomes. Design, Setting, Participants, and Outcome: Levels of unconjugated (uBPA) and BPA glucuronide in 80 matching samples of pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy and at delivery and matching term cord blood obtained from a prospective study conducted at the University of Michigan Hospitals were determined using a methodology validated in the National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences funded Round Robin study and related to pregnancy outcomes. Results: Highest levels of uBPA were found in maternal term samples followed by first trimester maternal (M1) samples and cord blood. A 2-fold increase in M1 uBPA was associated with 55-g less birth weight when male and female pregnancies were combined and 183-g less birth weight with only female pregnancies. A 2-fold increase in maternal term uBPA was associated with an increased gestational length of 0.7 days for all pregnancies and 1.1 days for only female pregnancies. Conclusion: Higher uBPA exposure levels during first trimester and term are associated with sex-specific reduction in birth weight and increase in gestational length, respectively. Race, parity, and employment have an effect on BPA exposure. Because low birth weight is associated with adverse health outcomes, effect of early pregnancy BPA levels on reducing birth weight highlights the risk posed by developmental exposure to BPA.},

Developmental exposures to BPA have been linked to adult metabolic pathologies, but the pathways through which these disruptions occur remain unknown. This is a comprehensive interspecies association vs causal study to evaluate risks posed by prenatal BPA exposure and to facilitate discovery of biomarkers of relevance to BPA toxicity. Samples from human pregnancies during the first trimester and at term, as well as fetal and/or adult samples from prenatally BPA-treated sheep, rats, and mice, were collected to assess the impact of BPA on free fatty acid and oxidative stress dynamics. Mothers exposed to higher BPA during early to midpregnancy and their matching term cord samples displayed increased 3-nitrotyrosine (NY), a marker of nitrosative stress. Maternal samples had increased palmitic acid, which was positively correlated with NY. Sheep fetuses and adult sheep and rats prenatally exposed to a human-relevant exposure dose of BPA showed increased systemic nitrosative stress. The strongest effect of BPA on circulating free fatty acids was observed in adult mice in the absence of increased oxidative stress. This is the first multispecies study that combines human association and animal causal studies assessing the risk posed by prenatal BPA exposure to metabolic health. This study provides evidence of the induction of nitrosative stress by prenatal BPA in both the mother and fetus at time of birth and is thus supportive of the use of maternal NY as a biomarker for offspring health.},

Despite human exposure to BPs through dermal application of products containing sunscreen agents and the increasing evidence that BPs are able to interfere with endocrine systems, few studies have examined the occurrence of BPs in humans. In this work, we propose a new liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method to determine six BPs, namely, benzophenone-1 (BP-1), benzophenone-2 (BP-2), benzophenone-3 (BP-3), benzophenone-6 (BP-6), benzophenone-8 (BP-8) and 4-hydroxybenzophenone (4-OH-BP) in human placental tissue samples. The method involves an extraction step of the analytes from the samples using ethyl acetate, followed by a clean-up step using centrifugation prior to their quantification by LC-MS/MS using an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) interface in the positive mode. Benzophenone-d(10) (BP-d(10)) was used as surrogate. Found detection limits (LOD) ranged from 0.07 to 0.3 ng g(-1) and quantification limits (LOQ) from 0.3 to 1.0 ng g(-1), while inter- and intra-day variability was under 5\%. The method was validated using standard addition calibration and a recovery assay. Recovery rates for spiked samples ranged from 98 to 104\%.

  abstract = {In recent decades, the industrial development has resulted in the appearance of a large amount of new chemicals that are able to produce disorders in the human endocrine system. These substances, so-called endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), include many families of compounds, such as parabens and benzophenone-UV filters. Taking into account the demonstrated biological activity of these compounds, it is necessary to develop new analytical procedures to assess the exposure in order to establish, in an accurate way, relationships between EDCs and harmful health effects in population. In the present work, a new method based on a simplified sample treatment by matrix solid phase dispersion (MSPD) followed by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography\textendash tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC\textendash MS/MS) analysis, is validated for the determination of four parabens (methyl-, ethyl-, propyl- and butylparaben) and six benzophenone-UV filters (benzophenone-1, benzophenone-2, benzophenone-3, benzophenone-6, benzophenone-8 and 4-hydroxybenzophenone) in human placental tissue samples. The extraction parameters were accurately optimized using multivariate optimization strategies. Ethylparaben ring-13C6 and benzophenone-d10 were used as surrogates. The found limits of quantification ranged from 0.2 to 0.4ngg-1 and inter-day variability (evaluated as relative standard deviation) ranged from 5.4\% to 12.8\%. The method was validated using matrix-matched standard calibration followed by a recovery assay with spiked samples. Recovery rates ranged from 96\% to 104\%. The method was satisfactorily applied for the determination of compounds in human placental tissue samples collected at the moment of delivery from 10 randomly selected women.},

Gestational weight gain, which is associated negatively with PCB levels in maternal and cord blood, and positively with birth weight, could substantially confound this association.Objective: We sought to estimate the influence of gestational weight gain on the association between PCB-153 exposure and birth weight using a pharmacokinetic model.Methods: We modified a recently published pharmacokinetic model and ran Monte Carlo simulations accounting for variability in physiologic parameters and their correlations. We evaluated the pharmacokinetic model by comparing simulated plasma PCB-153 levels during pregnancy to serial measurements in 10 pregnant women from another study population. We estimated the association between simulated plasma PCB-153 levels and birth weight using linear regression models.Results: The plasma PCB-153 level profiles generated with the pharmacokinetic model were comparable to measured levels in 10 pregnant women. We estimated a 118-g decrease in birth weight (95\% CI: \textendash 129, \textendash 106 g) for each 1-{$\mu$}g/L increase in simulated cord plasma PCB-153, compared with the 150-g decrease estimated based on the previous meta-analysis. The estimated decrease in birth weight was reduced to \textendash 6 g (95\% CI: \textendash 18, 6 g) when adjusted for simulated gestational weight gain.Conclusion: Our findings suggest that associations previously noted between PCB levels and birth weight may be attributable to confounding by maternal weight gain during pregnancy.Citation: Verner MA, McDougall R, Glynn A, Andersen ME, Clewell HJ III, Longnecker MP. 2013.

  abstract = {Background:~         Within-subject biospecimens pooling can theoretically reduce bias in dose\textendash response functions from biomarker-based studies when exposure assessment suffers from classical-type error. However, collecting many urine voids each day is cumbersome. We evaluated the empirical validity of a within-subject pooling approach and compared several options to avoid sampling each void.         Methods:~         In 16 pregnant women who collected a spot of each urine void over several nonconsecutive weeks, we compared concentrations of 10 phenols in daily, weekly, and pregnancy within-subject pools. We pooled either three or all daily samples. In a simulation study using these data, we quantified bias in dose\textendash response functions when using one to 20 urine samples per subject to assess methylparaben (a compound with moderate within-subject variability) and bisphenol A (high variability) exposures.         Results:~         Correlations between exposure estimates from pools of all and of only three voids per day were above 0.80 for all time windows and compounds, except for benzophenone-3 and triclosan in the daily time window (correlations, 0.57\textendash 0.68). With one spot sample to assess pregnancy exposure, correlations were all below 0.74. Using only one biospecimen led to attenuation bias in the dose\textendash response functions of 29\% (methylparaben) and 69\% (bisphenol A); four samples for methylparaben and 18 for bisphenol A decreased bias to 10\%.         Conclusions:~         For nonpersistent chemicals, collecting and pooling three samples per day instead of all daily samples efficiently estimates exposures over a week or more. Collecting around 20 biospecimens can strongly limit attenuation bias for nonpersistent chemicals such as bisphenol A.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate DNA methylation and expression of imprinted genes and an imprinted gene network (IGN) in neonates conceived via assisted reproductive technology (ART). DESIGN: Case control. SETTING: Research institution. PATIENT(S): Two hundred sixty-four cases of cord blood and/or placental villi from neonates (101 IVF, 81 ICSI, 82 naturally conceived). INTERVENTION(S): Placentas were obtained at birth for biopsy and cord blood extraction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): DNA methylation and expression of imprinted genes. RESULT(S): DNA methylation at the PLAGL1 differentially methylated region (DMR) was significantly higher in IVF cord blood (48.0\%) compared with controls (46.0\%). No differences were found in DNA methylation between conception modes for KvDMR1 and LINE-1 in cord blood and placenta as well as PLAGL1 and PEG10 in placenta villi. PLAGL1 expression was lower in both IVF and ICSI cord blood groups than in controls (relative quantification of 0.65, 0.74, 0.89, respectively). Analyzing the expression of 3 genes in a PLAGL1 regulated IGN revealed different expression between conception modes and a significant correlation to PLAGL1 expression in only one (KCNQ1OT1). CONCLUSION(S): Our results suggest a stability of DNA methylation at imprinted DMRs; however, we show PLAGL1 methylation/expression to be altered after ART. As PLAGL1 expression correlated with only one of the three IGN genes in cord blood, we propose there is a more complex mechanism of regulating the IGN that may involve other genes and epigenetic modifications in this tissue. Further research investigating IGN-implicated genes in various neonatal tissues is warranted to elucidate the full effects ART-induced alterations to PLAGL1 and the IGN may have on fetal growth/development.},

Maternal characteristics and physiological changes during gestation, such as gestational weight gain (GWG), may have an influence in the overall burden of POPs in neonates. However, the associations between GWG and POP concentrations are still not well established. Objective: We examined the association of GWG with cord serum POPs concentrations after adjusting for prepregnancy maternal body mass index (BMI) and other potential determinants of the transfer of POPs into newborns. The GWG values were evaluated after grouping by the reference guidelines of the Institute of Medicine (IOM). Methods: We measured levels of 14 organochlorine pesticides, 7 polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), and 14 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in 325 cord serum samples from a Spanish birth cohort. Multivariable models were used to estimate associations of GWG, prepregnancy BMI, and other maternal determinants on cord serum concentrations of POPs. Results: Neonatal concentrations of POPs were inversely associated with GWG after adjustment for age, prepregnancy BMI, educational level, and fish consumption. On average, neonates of women with IOM-recommended GWG have lower POP concentrations than do neonates of mothers with inadequate GWG. Conclusions: The present findings suggest an association between neonatal exposure to POPs and inadequate GWG during pregnancy. Encouraging pregnant women to meet the recommended IOM guidelines for GWG may reduce the accumulation of POPs in newborns.},

  abstract = {Background: Previous studies showed that children exposed to paracetamol during fetal life might have an increased risk of neurodevelopmental problems. Since paracetamol is one of the most commonly used medications during pregnancy, even small increases in the risk of neurodevelopmental problems may have considerable implications for public health.,  Methods: Using data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, we applied propensity score (PS) matching to examine associations between prenatal paracetamol exposure and neurodevelopmental problems among children at 18 months of age. Paracetamol use was classified into short-term ({$<$} 28 days) and long-term ({$\geq$} 28 days) of exposure.,  Results: Of the 51\,200 pregnancies included in our study, 40.5\% of mothers (n\,=\,20\,749) used paracetamol at least once during pregnancy. In the PS-matched analyses, long-term paracetamol exposure during pregnancy was associated with communication problems [odds ratio (OR): 1.38, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.98\textendash 1.95) and delayed motor milestone attainment (OR: 1.35, 95\% CI 1.07\textendash 1.70). We did not observe increased risks after short-term exposure. Sensitivity analyses for several indications showed similar effects as the PS-matched analyses, suggesting no confounding by indication.,  Conclusion: Long-term exposure to paracetamol in utero was associated with modestly increased risks of motor milestone delay and impaired communication skills among children at 18 months. Caution is warranted when considering long-term use of paracetamol during pregnancy; however, women with severe pain conditions should not be deprived of appropriate pharmacotherapy.},

We conducted a review of the literature on relationships between prenatal and early life exposure to mixtures of lead (Pb), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and manganese (Mn) with neurodevelopmental outcomes. We then used an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework to integrate lines of evidence from multiple disciplines based on evolving guidance developed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Toxicological evidence suggests a greater than additive effect of combined exposures to As-Pb-Cd and to Mn with any other metal, and several epidemiologic studies also suggest synergistic effects from binary combinations of Pb-As, Pb-Cd, and Pb-Mn. The exposure levels reported in these epidemiologic studies largely fall at the high-end (e.g., 95th percentile) of biomonitoring data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), suggesting a small but significant potential for high-end exposures. This review integrates multiple data sources using an AOP framework and provides an initial application of the OECD guidance in the context of potential neurodevelopmental toxicity of several metals, recognizing the evolving nature of regulatory interpretation and acceptance.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Parabens are a group of esters of para-hydroxybenzoic acid utilized as antimicrobial preservatives in many personal care products. Epidemiological studies regarding the adverse effects of parabens on fetuses are limited. The aim of this study was to determine the association between placental paraben exposure and birth outcomes. We assessed paraben concentrations in placental tissue, which potentially gives a better understanding of fetal exposure than the maternal urinary concentrations which are the current golden standard. METHODS: Placental tissue was collected immediately after birth from 142 mother-child pairs from the ENVIRONAGE birth cohort. The placental concentrations of four parabens (methyl (MeP), ethyl (EtP), propyl (PrP), and butyl (BuP)) were determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass-spectrometry. Generalized linear regression models were used to determine the association between paraben exposure levels and birth outcomes. RESULTS: The geometric means of placental MeP, EtP, PrP, and BuP were 1.84, 2.16, 1.68 and 0.05\,ng/g tissue, respectively. The sum of parabens ({$\sum$} parabens, including MeP, EtP and PrP) was negatively associated with birth weight in newborn girls (-\,166\,g, 95\% CI: -\,322, -\,8.6, p\,=\,0.04) after adjustment for a priori selected covariates. The sum of parabens was negatively associated with head circumference (-\,0.6\,cm, 95\% CI: -\,1.1, -\,0.2, p\,=\,0.008) and borderline associated with birth length (-\,0.6\,cm, 95\% CI:-1.3, 0.1, p\,=\,0.08). In newborn girls the placental concentration of EtP was negatively associated with head circumference (-\,0.6\,cm, 95\% CI:-1.1, -\,0.1, p\,=\,0.01) and borderline significantly associated with birth weight and birth length. Lastly, placental EtP and {$\sum$}parabens were negatively associated with placental weight in newborn girls but not in newborn boys (-\,45.3\,g, 95\% CI:-86.2, -\,4.4, p\,=\,0.03). CONCLUSION: The negative association between maternal paraben exposure and birth outcomes warrants further research and follow-up over time to determine long term effects of gestational exposure to parabens.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Developmental periods in early life may be particularly vulnerable to impacts of environmental exposures. Human research on this topic has generally focused on single exposure-health effect relationships. The "exposome" concept encompasses the totality of exposures from conception onward, complementing the genome. OBJECTIVES: The Human Early-Life Exposome (HELIX) project is a new collaborative research project that aims to implement novel exposure assessment and biomarker methods to characterize early-life exposure to multiple environmental factors and associate these with omics biomarkers and child health outcomes, thus characterizing the "early-life exposome." Here we describe the general design of the project. METHODS: In six existing birth cohort studies in Europe, HELIX will estimate prenatal and postnatal exposure to a broad range of chemical and physical exposures. Exposure models will be developed for the full cohorts totaling 32,000 mother-child pairs, and biomarkers will be measured in a subset of 1,200 mother-child pairs. Nested repeat-sampling panel studies (n = 150) will collect data on biomarker variability, use smartphones to assess mobility and physical activity, and perform personal exposure monitoring. Omics techniques will determine molecular profiles (metabolome, proteome, transcriptome, epigenome) associated with exposures. Statistical methods for multiple exposures will provide exposure-response estimates for fetal and child growth, obesity, neurodevelopment, and respiratory outcomes. A health impact assessment exercise will evaluate risks and benefits of combined exposures. CONCLUSIONS: HELIX is one of the first attempts to describe the early-life exposome of European populations and unravel its relation to omics markers and health in childhood. As proof of concept, it will form an important first step toward the life-course exposome.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chemical and nonchemical environmental exposures are increasingly suspected to influence the development of obesity, especially during early life, but studies mostly consider single exposure groups. OBJECTIVES: Our study aimed to systematically assess the association between a wide array of early-life environmental exposures and childhood obesity, using an exposome-wide approach. METHODS: The HELIX (Human Early Life Exposome) study measured child body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, skinfold thickness, and body fat mass in 1,301 children from six European birth cohorts age 6-11 y. We estimated 77 prenatal exposures and 96 childhood exposures (cross-sectionally), including indoor and outdoor air pollutants, built environment, green spaces, tobacco smoking, and biomarkers of chemical pollutants (persistent organic pollutants, metals, phthalates, phenols, and pesticides). We used an exposure-wide association study (ExWAS) to screen all exposure-outcome associations independently and used the deletion-substitution-addition (DSA) variable selection algorithm to build a final multiexposure model. RESULTS: The prevalence of overweight and obesity combined was 28.8\%. Maternal smoking was the only prenatal exposure variable associated with higher child BMI (z-score increase of 0.28, 95\% confidence interval: 0.09, 0.48, for active vs. no smoking). For childhood exposures, the multiexposure model identified particulate and nitrogen dioxide air pollution inside the home, urine cotinine levels indicative of secondhand smoke exposure, and residence in more densely populated areas and in areas with fewer facilities to be associated with increased child BMI. Child blood levels of copper and cesium were associated with higher BMI, and levels of organochlorine pollutants, cobalt, and molybdenum were associated with lower BMI. Similar results were found for the other adiposity outcomes. DISCUSSION: This first comprehensive and systematic analysis of many suspected environmental obesogens strengthens evidence for an association of smoking, air pollution exposure, and characteristics of the built environment with childhood obesity risk. Cross-sectional biomarker results may suffer from reverse causality bias, whereby obesity status influenced the biomarker concentration. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5975.},

  abstract = {Introduction Copper is essential micronutrient and has an important role in the human body. The serum copper increases during pregnancy and is doubled at full term. Lower levels of serum copper in preg\- nancy are connected with some pathological conditions. Objective The aim of this study was to estimate the levels of serum copper in normal and pathological pregnancies, comparing them with values of serum copper in non-pregnant women, to determine if serum copper is lower in some pathological pregnancies and if this is of some importance. Methods A total of 2170 plasma samples for copper analyses were made in the following groups: healthy non-pregnant women; healthy pregnant women from the 5th-40th gestational week, during the first delivery stage and during the first three postpartum weeks, in pregnant women with habitual abortion, imminent abortion, abortion in progress, missed abortion (9th-24th weeks), missed labour and prema\- ture rupture of membranes (29th-40th weeks). Levels of serum copper were determined by colorimetric technique of bathocuproin with disulphate as a chromogen. Results Serum copper values in non-pregnant women range from 11.6-25.8 \textmu mol/L. In healthy preg\- nant women, there is a constant trend of the increase of serum copper. The mean serum copper val\- ues revealed three significant peaks at the 22nd, 27th and 35th gestational week. Serum copper values in the patients with some pathological pregnancies in relation to the serum copper values of the healthy pregnant women were significantly lower. Conclusion Serum copper values can be used as an indicator of some pathological pregnancies.},

  abstract = {Executive function is a critical behavioral trait rarely studied in relation to potential neurotoxicants. Prenatal exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) has been associated with adverse neurodevelopment, but there is limited research on executive function. Data from 256 mother-child pairs in the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment Study, a prospective birth cohort (2003-2006, Cincinnati, OH), was used to examine maternal serum PBDEs and PFASs and executive function in children ages 5 and 8 years. Maternal serum PBDEs and PFASs were measured at 16{$\pm$}3 weeks gestation. Executive function was assessed with the parent-rated Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF), which yields composite measures: behavioral regulation index, metacognition index, and global executive composite. Higher BRIEF scores indicate executive function impairments. Linear mixed models and generalized estimating equations were used to estimate covariate-adjusted associations between PBDEs and PFASs and executive function. A 10-fold increase in BDE-153 was associated with poorer behavior regulation ({$\beta$}=3.23, 95\% CI 0.60, 5.86). Higher odds of having a score {$\geq$}60 in behavior regulation (OR=3.92, 95\% CI 1.76, 8.73) or global executive functioning (OR=2.34, 95\% CI 1.05, 5.23) was observed with increased BDE-153. Each ln-unit increase in perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was associated with poorer behavior regulation ({$\beta$}=3.14, 95\% CI 0.68, 5.61), metacognition ({$\beta$}=3.10, 95\% CI 0.62, 5.58), and global executive functioning ({$\beta$}=3.38, 95\% CI 0.86, 5.90). However, no association was observed between perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and executive function. Prenatal exposures to BDE-153 and PFOS may be associated with executive function deficits in school-age children.},

However, few epidemiological studies have examined the impact of childhood PFAS on neurodevelopment. Methods: We employed data from 208 children in the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment Study, a birth cohort (Cincinnati, OH), to examine associations of six serum PFAS concentrations measured at 3 and 8 years with executive function assessed at 8 years using the validated parent-completed Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function survey. We used multiple informant models to identify susceptible windows of neurotoxicity to PFAS and executive function. We investigated trajectories of PFAS concentrations and whether sex modified these associations. Results: Each ln-increase in perfluorononanoate (PFNA) at 8 years was associated with a 3.4-point increase (95\% CI 0.4, 6.3) in metacognition score, indicating poorer function. Children with PFNA above the median at 8 years had poorer global executive functioning compared to children with concentrations consistently below median levels ({$\beta$} = 6.5, 95\% CI 0.2, 12.9). Higher concurrent PFNA was associated with poorer behavior regulation among males, while associations among females were null (pPFNA\texttimes sex = 0.018). Children with higher concurrent perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) had increased odds of being at risk of having clinical impairments in metacognition (OR = 3.18, 95\% CI 1.17, 8.60). There were no associations between perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorohexane sulfonate and executive function. Conclusions: PFNA and PFOA at 8 years, but not 3 years, may be related to poorer executive function at 8 years. Results need to be confirmed in cohort studies with larger sample sizes.},

Methods: Using data from 218 mother-child dyads from the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment Study, we examined prenatal and childhood (3 and 8 years) serum concentrations of four PFAS and inattention, impulsivity, and visual spatial abilities. At 8 years, we used the Conners' Continuous Performance Test-II to assess attention and impulse control and the Virtual Morris Water Maze (VMWM) to measure visual spatial abilities. Results: In multiple informant models, there was no evidence to indicate that prenatal or childhood PFAS are associated with attention. However, there was an inverse association between prenatal ln-perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and errors of commission ({$\beta$} = -2.0, 95\% Confidence Interval [CI] -3.8, -0.3). Ln-perfluorononanoate (PFNA) at 3 years was associated with longer (poorer) VMWM completion times of 3.6 seconds (CI 1.6, 5.6). However, higher concurrent concentrations of ln-perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) ({$\beta$} = -2.4 s, 95\% CI -4.4, -0.3) were associated with shorter (better) times. Higher prenatal PFHxS was positively associated with percentage of traveling distance in the correct quadrant ({$\beta$} = 4.2\%, 95\% CI 0.8, 7.7), indicating better performance. Conclusion: Findings were mixed for prenatal and childhood PFAS concentrations and visual spatial abilities. There is not enough evidence to support that PFAS are associated with visual spatial abilities as assessed by the VMWM or CPT-II measures of inattention or impulsivity in children at age 8 years.},

As such, we reviewed epidemiologic studies published to date to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on PBDEs' potential role in behavioral development. We identified 19 epidemiologic studies reporting on associations of prenatal and childhood concentrations of PBDEs with behaviors assessed in children from 1 to 12 years, including executive function, attention, externalizing and internalizing behaviors, adaptive skills, and social behaviors/Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). While the mechanisms of PBDE neurotoxicity in humans are still not clearly elucidated, findings from this review indicate that PBDE exposure during fetal development is associated with impairments in executive function and poorer attentional control in children. Results from large prospective cohorts demonstrate that prenatal and postnatal PBDE exposure adversely impacts externalizing behavior (e.g., hyperactivity and conduct problems). Additional studies are needed to determine whether PBDEs are associated with internalizing problems, adaptive skills, and social behaviors/ASD in children. Future studies will help better understand the potential neurotoxic effects of PBDE exposures during adolescence, possible sex-dependent effects, and the impact of exposure to BDE-209 and alternative flame retardants. Future studies should also examine chemical mixtures to capture real-world exposures when examining PBDEs and their impact on various behavioral domains in the context of multiple chemical exposures.},

RESULTS: Prenatal and childhood perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) were not associated with WISC-IV measures. We observed an increase of 4.1-points (95\% CI 0.3, 8.0) and 5.7-points (95\% CI 1.2, 10.2) in working memory with 1-ln unit increase in prenatal perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorononanoate (PFNA), respectively. In addition, PFNA at 3 years was associated with better FSIQ and perceptual reasoning. Child sex modified the relationship between prenatal PFOA and FSIQ; the association was positive in females only. Sex also modified the association between concurrent PFOS and FSIQ, with males having higher scores. CONCLUSION: We did not observe adverse associations between prenatal and childhood PFAS and cognitive function at age 8 years.},

  abstract = {In both human and animals, in utero exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine-disrupting chemical used in the production of plastics and epoxy resins, has been shown to affect offspring reproductive and metabolic health during adult life. We hypothesized that the effect of prenatal exposure to environmentally relevant doses of BPA will be evident during fetal organogenesis and fetal/postnatal growth trajectory. Pregnant ewes were administered BPA subcutaneously from 30 to 90~days of gestation (term 147~days). Fetal organ weight, anthropometric measures, maternal/fetal hormones and postnatal growth trajectory were measured in both sexes. Gestational BPA administration resulted in higher accumulation in male than female fetuses only at fetal day 65, with minimal impact on fetal/maternal steroid milieu in both sexes at both time points. BPA-treated male fetuses were heavier than BPA-treated female fetuses at fetal day 90 whereas this sex difference was not evident in the control group. At the organ level, liver weight was reduced in prenatal BPA-treated female fetuses, while heart and thyroid gland weights were increased in BPA-treated male fetuses relative to their sex-matched control groups. Prenatal BPA treatment also altered the postnatal growth trajectory in a sex-specific manner. Males grew slower during the early postnatal period and caught up later. Females, in contrast, demonstrated the opposite growth trend. Prenatal BPA-induced changes in fetal organ differentiation and early life growth strongly implicate translational relevance of in utero contributions to reproductive and metabolic defects previously reported in adult female offspring.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Thyroid hormone (TH) is essential for normal development; therefore, disruption of TH action by a number of industrial chemicals is critical to identify. Several chemicals including polychlorinated biphenyls are metabolized by the dioxin-inducible enzyme CYP1A1; some of their metabolites can interact with the TH receptor. In animals, this mechanism is reflected by a strong correlation between the expression of CYP1A1 mRNA and TH-regulated mRNAs. If this mechanism occurs in humans, we expect that CYP1A1 expression will be positively correlated with the expression of genes regulated by TH. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that CYP1A1 mRNA expression is correlated with TH-regulated mRNAs in human placenta. METHODS: One hundred sixty-four placental samples from pregnancies with no thyroid disease were obtained from the GESTE study (Sherbrooke, Qu\'ebec, Canada). Maternal and cord blood TH levels were measured at birth. The mRNA levels of CYP1A1 and placental TH receptor targets [placental lactogen (PL) and GH-V] were quantitated by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: CYP1A1 mRNA abundance varied 5-fold across 132 placental samples that had detectable CYP1A1 mRNA. CYP1A1 mRNA was positively correlated with PL (r = 0.64; P {$<$} .0001) and GH-V (P {$<$} .0001, r = 0.62) mRNA. PL and GH-V mRNA were correlated with each other (r = 0.95; P {$<$} .0001), suggesting a common activator. The mRNAs not regulated by TH were not correlated with CYP1A1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: CYP1A1 mRNA expression is strongly associated with the expression of TH-regulated target gene mRNAs in human placenta, consistent with the endocrine-disrupting action of metabolites produced by CYP1A1.},

Some studies suggest that epigenetic changes might be causal in the development of the psychiatric condition under investigation. However, other scenarios are possible, e.g., statistical confounding or reverse causation, making it particularly challenging to derive conclusions on causality. In the present review, we examine the evidence from human population studies for a possible role of epigenetic mechanisms in neurodevelopment and mental health and discuss methodological approaches on how to strengthen causal inference, including the need for replication, (quasi-)experimental approaches and Mendelian randomization. We signpost openly accessible resources (e.g., ``MR-Base'' ``EWAS catalog'' as well as tissue-specific methylation and gene expression databases) to aid the application of these approaches.},

  abstract = {Angiogenesis is a highly organized process controlled by a series of molecular events. While much effort has been devoted to identifying angiogenic factors and their reciprocal receptors, far less information is available on the molecular mechanisms underlying directed endothelial cell migration. To search for novel proteins that participate in this process, we used the serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) transcript profiling approach to identify genes that are selectively expressed in endothelial cells (ECs). Two EC SAGE libraries were constructed from human umbilical vein and artery ECs to enable data-mining against other non-ECs. A novel endothelial protein, Thrombospondin Type I Domain Containing 7A (THSD7A), with preferential expression in placenta vasculature and in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was identified and targeted for further characterization. Overexpression of a THSD7A carboxyl-terminal fragment in HUVECs inhibited cell migration and disrupted tube formation, while suppression of THSD7A expression enhanced HUVEC migration and tube formation. Immunohistological analysis revealed that THSD7A was expressed at the leading edge of migrating HUVECs, and it co-localized with {$\alpha$}V{$\beta$}3 integrin and paxillin. This distribution was dispersed from focal adhesions after disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting the involvement of THSD7A in cytoskeletal organization. Our results show that THSD7A is a novel placenta endothelial protein that mediates EC migration and tube formation, and they highlight its potential as a new target for anti-angiogenic therapy. J.

  abstract = {One of the dominant effects of glucocorticoids in triggering parturition in certain animal species is to drive the placental conversion of progesterone to estrogen. However, in the human placenta, estrogen is formed using dehydroepiandrosterone from the fetal adrenal glands rather than progesterone as precursor. Although aromatization of dehydroepiandrosterone is crucial in estrogen synthesis in human placenta, it is not known whether glucocorticoids affect aromatase expression. Human term placental syncytiotrophoblasts were used to examine the effect of cortisol on aromatase expression. The signaling pathway and transcription factors involved were identified in this study. Results showed that cortisol induced aromatase expression in a concentration-dependent manner, which was mediated indirectly by glucocorticoid receptor and required the participation of other proteins. The induction of aromatase by cortisol could be blocked by either specificity protein 1 (Sp1) antagonist mithramycin or knockdown of Sp1 expression. The induction of aromatase and Sp1 by cortisol could be prevented by inhibitors of the cAMP pathway, whereas activators of the cAMP pathway induced Sp1 and aromatase expression as well as Sp1 binding to aromatase promoter. Concomitantly, cortisol treatment and activation of the cAMP pathway led to increased acetylation and decreased methylation of histone 3 at the aromatase promoter. In conclusion, cortisol stimulates aromatase expression through the cAMP/Sp1 pathway in human placental syncytiotrophoblasts. These findings reveal a novel role of cortisol in increasing the local level of estrogen within the placenta that would help transform the myometrium to a contractile state, thereby contributing to a cascade of events leading to human parturition.},

Epigenetic regulation encompasses three types of changes: DNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNAs, each of which has been shown to play a key role in controlling epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer metastasis. As we gain deeper understanding of epigenetic mechanisms controlling EMT processes and orchestrating all the metastatic steps, we broaden the therapeutic potentials of epigenetic drugs, such as DNA demethylating drugs and histone deacetylase/demethylase inhibitors, which can act upon metastasis-related genes, restoring their expression and biological functions.},

This platform can efficiently and simultaneously measure methylation levels at {$\sim$}480,000 CpG sites in the human genome in multiple study samples. Due to the intrinsic chip design of 2 types of chemistry probes, data normalization or preprocessing is a critical step to consider before data analysis. To date, numerous methods and pipelines have been developed for this purpose, and some studies have been conducted to evaluate different methods. However, validation studies have often been limited to a small number of CpG sites to reduce the variability in technical replicates. In this study, we measured methylation on a set of samples using both whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and 450K chips. We used WGBS data as a gold standard of true methylation states in cells to compare the performances of 8 normalization methods for 450K data on a genome-wide scale. Analyses on our dataset indicate that the most effective methods are peak-based correction (PBC) and quantile normalization plus {$\beta$}-mixture quantile normalization (QN.BMIQ). To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically compare existing normalization methods for Illumina 450K data using novel WGBS data. Our results provide a benchmark reference for the analysis of DNA methylation chip data, particularly in white blood cells.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phthalates may increase the asthma risk in children. Mechanisms underlying this association remain to be addressed. This study assesses the effect of phthalate exposures on epigenetic changes and the role of epigenetic changes for asthma. In the first step, urine and blood samples from 256 children of the Childhood Environment and Allergic diseases Study (CEAS) were analyzed. Urine 5OH-MEHP levels were quantified as an indicator of exposure, and asthma information was collected. DNA methylation (DNA-M) was measured by quantitative PCR. In the screening part of step 1, DNA-M of 21 potential human candidate genes suggested by a toxicogenomic data were investigated in 22 blood samples. Then, in the testing part of step 1, positively screened genes were tested in a larger sample of 256 children and then validated by protein measurements. In step 2, we replicated the association between phthalate exposure and gene-specific DNA-M in 54 children in the phthalate contaminated food event. In step 3, the risk of DNA-M for asthma was tested in 256 children from CEAS and corroborated in 270 children from the Isle of Wight (IOW) birth cohort. RESULTS: Differential methylation in three genes (AR, TNF{$\alpha$}, and IL-4) was identified through screening. Testing in 256 children showed that methylation of the TNF{$\alpha$} gene promoter was lower when children had higher urine 5OH-MEHP values ({$\beta$}\,=\,-0.138, P\,=\,0.040). Functional validation revealed that TNF{$\alpha$} methylation was inversely correlated with TNF{$\alpha$} protein levels ({$\beta$}\,=\,-0.18, P\,=\,0.041). In an additional sample of 54 children, we corroborated that methylation of the TNF{$\alpha$} gene promoter was lower when urine 5OH-MEHP concentrations were higher. Finally, we found that a lower methylation of 5'CGI region of TNF{$\alpha$} was associated with asthma in 256 CEAS children (OR\,=\,2.15, 95\% CI\,=\,1.01 to 4.62). We replicated this in 270 children from the IOW birth cohort study. Methylation of the CpG site cg10717214 was negatively associated with asthma, when children had 'AA' or 'AG' genotype of the TNF{$\alpha$} single nucleotide rs1800610. CONCLUSIONS: Effects of phthalate exposure on asthma may be mediated through alterations in DNA methylation.},

The zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression model has important applications for this type of data. With many possible candidate risk factors, this paper proposes new variable selection methods for the ZINB model. We consider maximum likelihood function plus a penalty including the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD), and minimax concave penalty (MCP). An EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm is proposed for estimating the model parameters and conducting variable selection simultaneously. This algorithm consists of estimating penalized weighted negative binomial models and penalized logistic models via the coordinated descent algorithm. Furthermore, statistical properties including the standard error formulae are provided. A simulation study shows that the new algorithm not only has more accurate or at least comparable estimation, but also is more robust than the traditional stepwise variable selection. The proposed methods are applied to analyze the health care demand in Germany using the open-source R package mpath.},

Here, we show that the level of urinary TCS in 28.3\% patients who had spontaneous abortion in mid-gestation were increased by 11.3-fold (high-TCS) compared with normal pregnancies. Oral administration of TCS (10\,mg/kg/day) in mice (TCS mice) caused an equivalent urinary TCS level as those in the high-TCS abortion patients. The TCS-exposure from gestation day (GD) 5.5 caused dose-dependently fetal death during GD12.5\textendash 16.5 with decline of live fetal weight. GD15.5 TCS mice appeared placental thrombus and tissue necrosis with enhancement of platelet aggregation. The levels of placenta and plasma estrogen sulfotransferase (EST) mRNA and protein in TCS mice or high-TCS abortion patients were not altered, but their EST activities were significantly reduced compared to controls. Although the levels of serum estrogen (E2) in TCS mice and high-TCS abortion patients had no difference from controls, their ratio of sulfo-conjugated E2 and unconjugated E2 was reduced. The estrogen receptor antagonist ICI-182,780 prevented the enhanced platelet aggregation and placental thrombosis and attenuated the fetal death in TCS mice. The findings indicate that TCS-exposure might cause spontaneous abortion probably through inhibition of EST activity to produce placental thrombosis.},

  abstract = {Pediatric cardiac surgery may lead to poor outcomes such as acute kidney injury (AKI) and prolonged hospital length of stay (LOS). Plasma and urine biomarkers may help with early identification and prediction of these adverse clinical outcomes. In a recent multi-center study, 311 children undergoing cardiac surgery were enrolled to evaluate multiple biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of AKI and other clinical outcomes. LOS is often analyzed as count data, thus Poisson regression and negative binomial (NB) regression are common choices for developing predictive models. With many correlated prognostic factors and biomarkers, variable selection is an important step. The present paper proposes new variable selection methods for Poisson and NB regression. We evaluated regularized regression through penalized likelihood function. We first extend the elastic net (Enet) Poisson to two penalized Poisson regression: Mnet, a combination of minimax concave and ridge penalties; and Snet, a combination of smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) and ridge penalties. Furthermore, we extend the above methods to the penalized NB regression. For the Enet, Mnet, and Snet penalties (EMSnet), we develop a unified algorithm to estimate the parameters and conduct variable selection simultaneously. Simulation studies show that the proposed methods have advantages with highly correlated predictors, against some of the competing methods. Applying the proposed methods to the aforementioned data, it is discovered that early postoperative urine biomarkers including NGAL, IL18, and KIM-1 independently predict LOS, after adjusting for risk and biomarker variables.},

With growing usage and mis-disposition of UV filters, they currently represent a new class of contaminants of emerging concern with increasingly reported adverse effects to humans and other organisms. Exposure to UV filters induce various endocrine disrupting effects, as revealed by increasing number of toxicological studies performed in recent years. It is necessary to compile a systematic review on the current research status on endocrine disrupting effects of UV filters toward different organisms. We therefore summarized the recent advances on the evaluation of the potential endocrine disruptors and the mechanism of toxicity for many kinds of UV filters such as benzophenones, camphor derivatives and cinnamate derivatives.},

  abstract = {Women exposed to phthalates during pregnancy are at increased risk for delivering preterm, but the mechanism behind this relationship is unknown. Placental corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) are key mediators of parturition and are regulated by the non-canonical NF-kB (RelB/p52) signaling pathway. In this study, we demonstrate that one of the major phthalate metabolites, mono-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (MEHP), increased CRH and COX-2 mRNA and protein abundance in a dose-dependent manner in primary cultures of cytotrophoblast. This was coupled with an increase in nuclear import of RelB/p52 and its association with the CRH and COX-2 promoters. Silencing of NF-kB inducing kinase, a central signaling component of the non-canonical NF-kB pathway, blocked MEHP-induced upregulation of CRH and COX-2. These results suggest a potential mechanism mediated by RelB/p52 by which phthalates could prematurely induce pro-labor gene activity and lead to preterm birth.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Triclosan (TCS) is a synthetic antibacterial chemical widely used in personal care products. TCS exposure has been associated with decreased thyroid hormone levels in animals, but human studies are scarce and controversial. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the association between maternal TCS exposure and thyroid hormone levels of mothers and newborns. METHODS: TCS was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) in urine samples collected during gestational weeks 38.8{$\pm$}1.1 from 398 pregnant women in a prospective birth cohort enrolled in 2012-2013 in Shanghai, China. Maternal serum levels of free thyroxine (FT4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) were obtained from medical records. Cord blood levels of free triiodothyronine (FT3), FT4, TSH, and TPOAb were measured. Multiple linear and logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship between maternal urinary TCS and thyroid hormone levels. RESULTS: TCS was detectable ({$\geq$}0.1 ng/mL) in 98.24\% of maternal urine samples with tertile of urinary TCS levels: low ({$>$}0.1-2.75 {$\mu$}g/g.Cr), medium (2.75\textendash 9.78 {$\mu$}g/g.Cr), and high (9.78\textendash 427.38 {$\mu$}g/g.Cr). With adjustment for potential confounders, cord blood log(FT3)pmol/L concentration was 0.11 lower in newborns of mothers with medium and high urinary TCS levels compared with those with low levels. At third trimester, the high TCS concentration was associated with 0.03 [95\% confidence interval (CI) -0.08, -0.02] lower maternal serum log(FT4)pmol/L, whereas the medium TCS concentration was associated with 0.15 (95\% CI: -0.28, -0.03) lower serum log(TSH)mIU/L with adjustment for covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest significant inverse associations between maternal urinary TCS and cord blood FT3 as well as maternal blood FT4 concentrations at third trimester. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP500.},

  abstract = {Neural tube defects (NTDs) are a spectrum of severe congenital malformations of fusion failure of the neural tube during early embryogenesis. Evidence on aberrant DNA methylation in NTD development remains scarce, especially when exposure to environmental pollutant is taken into consideration. DNA methylation profiling was quantified using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 array in neural tissues from 10 NTD cases and 8 non-malformed controls (stage 1). Subsequent validation was performed using a Sequenom MassARRAY system in neural tissues from 20 NTD cases and 20 non-malformed controls (stage 2). Correlation analysis of differentially methylated CpG sites in fetal neural tissues and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons concentrations in fetal neural tissues and maternal serum was conducted. Differentially methylated CpG sites of neural tissues were further validated in fetal mice with NTDs induced by benzo(a)pyrene given to pregnant mice. Differentially hypermethylated CpG sites in neural tissues from 17 genes and 6 pathways were identified in stage 1. Subsequently, differentially hypermethylated CpG sites in neural tissues from 6 genes (BDKRB2, CTNNA1, CYFIP2, MMP7, MYH2, and TIAM2) were confirmed in stage 2. Correlation analysis showed that methylated CpG sites in CTNNA1 and MYH2 from NTD cases were positively correlated to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon level in fetal neural tissues and maternal serum. The correlation was confirmed in NTD-affected fetal mice that were exposed to benzo(a)pyrene in utero. In conclusion, hypermethylation of the CTNNA1 and MYH2 genes in tight junction pathway is associated with the risk for NTDs, and the DNA methylation aberration may be caused by exposure to benzo(a)pyrene.},

Little is known about the potential impact of prenatal TCS exposure on fetal reproductive development as well as its potential mechanism. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the potential effect of prenatal TCS exposure on fetal reproductive hormones in cord blood and its potential mechanism in relation to placental steroidogenic enzymes. METHODS: Urinary TCS was detected among 537 healthy pregnant women from a prospective cohort in China. Four reproductive hormones in cord blood, namely E2 (n=430), T (n=424), LH (n=428) and FSH (n=373), and three steroidogenic enzymes in placenta, namely P450arom (n=233), 3{$\beta$}-HSD (n=227) and 17{$\beta$}-HSD (n=222), were measured. RESULTS: Prenatal TCS exposure was associated with increased testosterone concentrations in cord blood in a dose-dependent manner. Infants with prenatal TCS levels {$>$}0.6{$\mu$}g/L had, on average, a 0.23ng/mL (95\% CI: 0.05, 0.45, p=0.02) higher testosterone concentrations in cord blood compared to those with prenatal TCS levels {$<$}0.1{$\mu$}g/L. Of note, prenatal TCS exposure was associated with increased testosterone and decreased E2 concentrations in cord blood among male infants. Adverse associations were found between the prenatal TCS exposure and concentrations of three placental steroidogenic enzymes. 3{$\beta$}-HSD and P450arom demonstrated mediating effects in the association between prenatal TCS exposure and testosterone concentrations in cord blood. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested potential impacts of prenatal TCS exposure on reproductive hormones in cord blood mediated by steroidogenic enzymes, and male infants were more vulnerable.},

  abstract = {Background: The etiology and mechanism of spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) are still unclear. Accumulating evidence has documented that various environmental exposure scenarios may cause maternal and fetal epigenetic changes, which initiates the focus on whether epigenetics can contribute to the occurrence of sPTB. Therefore, we conducted the current study to examine and compare the DNA methylation changes associated with sPTB in placenta and cord blood. Methods: This hospital-based case-control study was carried out at three Women and Children's hospitals in South China, where 32 spontaneous preterm births and 16 term births were recruited. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of the placenta and cord blood from these subjects were measured using the Illumina HumanMethylation EPIC BeadChip, and sPTB-associated differential methylated CpG sites were identified using limma regression model, after controlling for major maternal and infant confounders. Further Gene Ontology analysis was performed with PANTHER in order to assess different functional enrichment of the sPTB-associated genes in placenta and cord blood. Results: After controlling for potential confounding factors, one differentially methylated position (DMP) in placenta and 31 DMPs in cord blood were found significantly associated with sPTB (Bonferroni corrected p {$<$} 0.05). The sPTBassociated CpG sites in placenta were mapped to genes that showed higher enrichment on biological processes including biological regulation, multicellular organismal process, and especially response to stimulus, while those in cord blood were mapped to genes that had higher enrichment on biological processes concerning cellular process, localization, and particularly metabolic process. Conclusion: Findings of this study indicated that DNA methylation alteration in both placenta and cord blood are associated with sPTB, yet the DNA methylation modification patterns may appear differently in placenta and cord blood.},

  abstract = {Phthalates (diesters of phthalic acid) are widely used as plasticizers and additives in many consumer products. Laboratory animal studies have reported the endocrine-disrupting and reproductive effects of phthalates, and human exposure to this class of chemicals is a concern. Several phthalates have been recognized as substances of high concern. Human exposure to phthalates occurs mainly via dietary sources, dermal absorption, and air inhalation. Phthalates are excreted as conjugated monoesters in urine, and some phthalates, such as di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), undergo secondary metabolism, including oxidative transformation, prior to urinary excretion. The occurrence of phthalates and their metabolites in urine, serum, breast milk, and semen has been widely reported. Urine has been the preferred matrix in human biomonitoring studies, and concentrations on the order of several tens to hundreds of nanograms per milliliter have been reported for several phthalate metabolites. Metabolites of diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl- (DBP) and diisobutyl- (DiBP) phthalates, and DEHP were the most abundant compounds measured in urine. Temporal trends in phthalate exposures varied among countries. In the United States (US), DEHP exposure has declined since 2005, whereas DiNP exposure has increased. In China, DEHP exposure has increased since 2000. For many phthalates, exposures in children are higher than those in adults. Human epidemiological studies have shown a significant association between phthalate exposures and adverse reproductive outcomes in women and men, type II diabetes and insulin resistance, overweight/obesity, allergy, and asthma. This review compiles biomonitoring studies of phthalates and exposure doses to assess health risks from phthalate exposures in populations across the globe.},

The general framework is to minimize a loss function subject to a penalty designed to generate sparse variable selection. Much of the previous work have focused on convex loss functions including generalized linear models. When data are contaminated with noise, robust loss functions are typically introduced. Recent literature has witnessed a growing impact of nonconvex loss-based methods, which can generate robust estimation for data contaminated with outliers. This article investigates robust variable selection based on penalized nonconvex loss functions. We investigate properties of the local and global minimizers of the original penalized loss function and the surrogate penalized loss function induced by the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm for numerical computation. We establish convergence theory of the proposed MM algorithm for penalized convex and nonconvex loss functions. Performance of the proposed algorithms for regression and classification problems are evaluated on simulated and real data including healthcare costs and cancer clinical status. Efficient implementations of the algorithms are available in the R package mpath in CRAN.},

The number of reports regarding to the profiling of m6A modification and its potential role in the placenta of preeclampsia (PE) is small. In this work, placental samples were collected from PE and control patients. Expression of m6A-related genes was investigated using quantitative real-time PCR. MeRIP-seq and RNA-seq were performed to detect m6A methylation and mRNA expression profiles. Gene ontology (GO) functional and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were also conducted to explore the modified genes and their clinical significance. Our findings show that METTL3 and METTL14 were up-regulated in PE. In total, 685 m6A peaks were differentially expressed as determined by MeRIP-seq. Altered peaks of m6A-modified transcripts were primarily associated with nitrogen compound metabolic process, positive regulation of vascular-associated smooth muscle cell migration, and endoplasmic reticulum organisation. The m6A hyper-methylated genes of Wnt/{$\beta$}-catenin signalling pathway, mTOR signalling pathway, and several cancer-related pathways may contribute to PE. We also verified that the significant increase of HSPA1A mRNA and protein expression was regulated by m6A modification, suggesting m6A plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression. Our data provide novel information regarding m6A modification alterations in PE and help our understanding of the pathogenesis of PE.},

These outcomes may be mediated by placental inflammation, which is the proposed biological mechanism. This is the first study to address the relationship between phthalate exposure and gene expression in placental inflammation in a sex-specific manner. We performed quantitative PCR to measure placental inflammatory mRNAs (CRP, TNF-{$\alpha$}, IL-1{$\beta$}, IL-6, IL-10, MCP-1, IL-8, CD68, and CD206) in 2469 placentae that were sampled at birth. We estimated the associations between mRNA and urinary phthalate monoesters using multiple linear regression models. Mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP) was correlated with higher IL-1{$\beta$}, IL-6, and CRP expression in placentae of male fetuses and with higher IL-6, CRP, MCP-1, IL-8, IL-10, and CD68 expression in placentae of female fetuses. Mono benzyl phthalate (MBzP) increased the expression of TNF-{$\alpha$}, MCP-1, and CD68 only in placentae of male fetuses. Mono (2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP) was negatively correlated with CRP, MCP-1, and CD68 in placentae of female fetuses. Maternal phthalate exposure was associated with inflammatory variations in placental tissues. The associations were stronger in placentae of male than of female fetuses. Compared with the other metabolites, MBP plays a strong role in these associations. The placenta is worth being further investigated as a potential mediator of maternal exposure-induced disease risk in children.},

Methods: We investigated phthalate exposure in pregnant women to explore the influence of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). In 2013, a total of 620 pregnant women in 30 counties (district) of Zhejiang Province were selected by probability proportionate to size sampling method, and they were interviewed for the sociodemographic characteristic, lifestyle characteristics, and 77 of them were selected by random and agreed to provide a urine sample. GC/MS method was used to determine the concentration of phthalate in urine including DMP, DEP, DIBP, DBP, BMPP, DPP, DHXP, BBP, HEP, BNBP, DCHP, DEHP, DOP, DNP, MMP, MEP, MBP, MEHP, ans MBzP. The distribution characteristics of the levels of phthalate between pregnant women with or without exposure to ETS were described, and logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the association between the phthalate levels and influencing factors. Results: We found that there was significant difference between pregnant women with or without exposure to ETS on DIBP, DBP, DNP (Z {$\frac{1}{4}$} 2.192, 2.172, 2356; p {$\frac{1}{4}$} .028, .030, .018).

The ART group consists of 30 cases of placenta and umbilical cord blood from ART full-term, uncomplicated singleton pregnancy progeny, and the normal control group consists of 30 cases of placenta and umbilical cord blood from natural full-term, uncomplicated singleton pregnancy progeny. The imprinted genes PEG10 and L3MBTL1 are analyzed, and the expression and methylation status of the two genes are detected using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR), immunohistochemistry (IHC), Western blotting (WB), and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP). Compared with the normal control group, the PEG10 mRNA relative quantity (RQ) value in the placenta is 0.994\,{$\pm$}\,0.458, with its RQ value up-regulated (P\,=\,0.015). The PEG10 mRNA RQ value in the umbilical cord blood is 0.875\,{$\pm$}\,0.452, with its RQ value up-regulated (P\,=\,0.002). However, the L3MBTL1 mRNA RQ value in the placenta is 0.404\,{$\pm$}\,0.234, with its RQ value down-regulated (P\,=\,0.024). The L3MBTL1 mRNA RQ value in the umbilical cord blood is 0.337\,{$\pm$}\,0.213, and there is no difference in the umbilical cord blood (P\,=\,0.081). Compared with the normal control group, the expression of PEGl0 protein in the placenta of the ART progeny is up-regulated (P\,=\,0.000), while the expression of L3MBTLl protein is down-regulated (P\,=\,0.000). The methylation status of the PEGl0 promoter region in the placenta in the ART group is lower than that in the normal control group (P\,=\,0.037), and that of the promoter region of the umbilical cord blood is lower than that of the natural pregnancy group (P\,=\,0.032). The methylation status of the L3MBTLl promoter region is higher in the placenta than in the normal control group (P\,=\,0.038), and there is no difference between the two groups in the umbilical cord blood (P\,=\,0.301). In the ART group, the values of PEGl0 and L3MBTLl RQ in the placenta and the umbilical cord blood of the hypermethylated group are lower than in those of the hypomethylated group. ART may increase the risk of the abnormal expression of PEG10 and L3MBTL1 in offspring imprinted genes. The methylation of the promoter region may be the mechanism that regulates the expression of PEGl0 and L3MBTL1.},

However, the effects of bisphenols on fetal growth in twins remain unclear. Objective To explore the associations of prenatal BPA, BPF, and BPS exposure with birth outcome differences in twins. Methods We recruited 289 twin pregnant women who visited the hospital for prenatal examination during the first trimester from 2013 to 2016. Urinary bisphenol levels were determined during the first, second, and third trimesters. The associations of maternal exposure to bisphenols with birth outcome differences in twins were analyzed after stratification by different trimesters. We applied the multiple informant model to estimate trimester-specific associations between urinary bisphenol concentrations and birth outcome differences in twins. Results We found low reproducibility (ICC{$<$}0.40) for maternal urinary BPA and moderate reproducibility (0.40~{$<~$}ICC{$<$}0.75) for BPF and BPS. Urinary BPA concentrations were positively associated with within-pair twin birth weight difference when comparing the third vs. the first tertile in each of the three trimesters (i.e., 133.06~g, 95\% CI: 68.19, 197.94; 144.5~g, 95\%CI: 81.82\textendash 207.18~g; and 135.04~g, 95\%CI: 71.37\textendash 198.71~g for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimester, respectively). The effect of urinary BPA concentration on increased birth length difference within-pair twins were also observed across different trimesters (All P for trends~{$<~$}0.05). Urinary BPA levels were positively associated with the within-pair birth weight and birth length differences across pregnancy trimesters (All of Type 3~P for values~{$<~$}0.05). Conclusion Maternal BPA exposure appeared to influence birth wight and birth length differences in twins. Our results warrant further confirmation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Growing evidence exists about the fetal and environmental origins of hypertension, but mainly limited to single-exposure studies. The exposome has been proposed as a more holistic approach by studying many exposures simultaneously. OBJECTIVES This study aims to evaluate the association between a wide range of prenatal and postnatal exposures and blood pressure (BP) in children. METHODS Systolic and diastolic BP were measured among 1,277 children from the European HELIX (Human Early-Life Exposome) cohort aged 6 to 11 years. Prenatal (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 89) and postnatal (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 128) exposures include air pollution, built environment, meteorology, natural spaces, traffic, noise, chemicals, and lifestyles. Two methods adjusted for confounders were applied: an exposome-wide association study considering the exposures independently, and the deletionsubstitution-addition algorithm considering all the exposures simultaneously. RESULTS Decreases in systolic BP were observed with facility density (b change for an interquartile-range increase in exposure: \`A1.7 mm Hg [95\% confidence interval (CI): \`A2.5 to \`A0.8 mm Hg]), maternal concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyl 118 (\`A1.4 mm Hg [95\% CI: \`A2.6 to \`A0.2 mm Hg]) and child concentrations of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE: \`A1.6 mm Hg [95\% CI: \`A2.4 to \`A0.7 mm Hg]), hexachlorobenzene (\`A1.5 mm Hg [95\% CI: \`A2.4 to \`A0.6 mm Hg]), and mono\`Abenzyl phthalate (\`A0.7 mm Hg [95\% CI: \`A1.3 to \`A0.1 mm Hg]), whereas increases in systolic BP were observed with outdoor temperature during pregnancy (1.6 mm Hg [95\% CI: 0.2 to 2.9 mm Hg]), high fish intake during pregnancy (2.0 mm Hg [95\% CI: 0.4 to 3.5 mm Hg]), maternal cotinine concentrations (1.2 mm Hg [95\% CI: -0.3 to 2.8 mm Hg]), and child perfluorooctanoate concentrations (0.9 mm Hg [95\% CI: 0.1 to 1.6 mm Hg]). Decreases in diastolic BP were observed with outdoor temperature at examination (\`A1.4 mm Hg [95\% CI: \`A2.3 to \`A0.5 mm Hg]) and child DDE concentrations (\`A1.1 mm Hg [95\% CI: \`A1.9 to \`A0.3 mm Hg]), whereas increases in diastolic BP were observed with maternal bisphenol-A concentrations (0.7 mm Hg [95\% CI: 0.1 to 1.4 mm Hg]), high fish intake during pregnancy (1.2 mm Hg [95\% CI: \`A0.2 to 2.7 mm Hg]), and child copper concentrations (0.9 mm Hg [95\% CI: 0.3 to 1.6 mm Hg]). CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that early-life exposure to several chemicals, as well as built environment and meteorological factors, may affect BP in children.

  abstract = {Throughout most of the mammalian genome, genetically regulated developmental programming establishes diverse yet predictable epigenetic states across differentiated cells and tissues. At metastable epialleles (MEs), conversely, epigenotype is established stochastically in the early embryo then maintained in differentiated lineages, resulting in dramatic and systemic interindividual variation in epigenetic regulation. In the mouse, maternal nutrition affects this process, with permanent phenotypic consequences for the offspring. MEs have not previously been identified in humans. Here, using an innovative 2-tissue parallel epigenomic screen, we identified putative MEs in the human genome. In autopsy samples, we showed that DNA methylation at these loci is highly correlated across tissues representing all 3 embryonic germ layer lineages. Monozygotic twin pairs exhibited substantial discordance in DNA methylation at these loci, suggesting that their epigenetic state is established stochastically. We then tested for persistent epigenetic effects of periconceptional nutrition in rural Gambians, who experience dramatic seasonal fluctuations in nutritional status. DNA methylation at MEs was elevated in individuals conceived during the nutritionally challenged rainy season, providing the first evidence of a permanent, systemic effect of periconceptional environment on human epigenotype. At MEs, epigenetic regulation in internal organs and tissues varies among individuals and can be deduced from peripheral blood DNA. MEs should therefore facilitate an improved understanding of the role of interindividual epigenetic variation in human disease.},

Animal and in vitro studies suggest that exposure to these compounds may be related to a number of adverse health outcomes, as well as potential mediators such as oxidative stress and inflammation. We examined urinary phenol (bisphenol A (BPA), triclosan (TCS), benzophenone-3 (BP-3), 2,4-dichlorophenol (24-DCP), 2,5-dichlorophenol (25-DCP)) and paraben (butyl paraben (B-PB), methyl paraben (M-PB), propyl paraben (P-PB)) concentrations measured three times during pregnancy in relation to markers of oxidative stress and inflammation among participants in the Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT) project. Serum markers of inflammation (c-reactive protein (CRP), IL-1{$\beta$}, IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-{$\alpha$} (TNF-{$\alpha$})) were measured twice during pregnancy (n=105 subjects, 187 measurements) and urinary markers of oxidative stress (8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (OHdG) and isoprostane) were measured three times during pregnancy (n=54 subjects, 146 measurements). We used linear mixed models to assess relationships between natural log-transformed exposure and outcome biomarkers while accounting for within individual correlation across study visits. After adjustment for urinary specific gravity, study visit, maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, and maternal education, an interquartile range (IQR) increase in urinary BPA was associated with 21\% higher OHdG (p=0.001) and 29\% higher isoprostane (p=0.0002), indicating increased oxidative stress. The adjusted increase in isoprostane per IQR increase in marker of exposure was 17\% for BP-3, 27\% for B-PB, and 20\% for P-PB (all p{$<$}0.05). An IQR increase in triclosan (TCS) was associated with 31\% higher serum concentrations of IL-6 (p=0.007), a pro-inflammatory cytokine. In contrast, IQR increases in BP-3 and B-PB were significantly associated with 16\% and 18\% lower CRP, a measure of systemic inflammation. Our findings suggest that exposure to BPA, select parabens, and TCS during pregnancy may be related to oxidative stress and inflammation, potential mechanisms by which exposure to these compounds may influence birth outcomes and other adverse health effects, but additional research is needed.},

Mammalian imprinted genes have been identified widely by experimental strategies or predicted using computational methods. Systematic information for these genes would be necessary for the identification of novel imprinted genes and the analysis of their regulatory mechanisms and functions. Here, a well-designed information repository, MetaImprint (http://bioinfo.hrbmu.edu.cn/MetaImprint), is presented, which focuses on the collection of information concerning mammalian imprinted genes. The current version of MetaImprint incorporates 539 imprinted genes, including 255 experimentally confirmed genes, and their detailed research courses from eight mammalian species. MetaImprint also hosts genome-wide genetic and epigenetic information of imprinted genes, including imprinting control regions, single nucleotide polymorphisms, non-coding RNAs, DNA methylation and histone modifications. Information related to human diseases and functional annotation was also integrated into MetaImprint. To facilitate data extraction, MetaImprint supports multiple search options, such as by gene ID and disease name. Moreover, a configurable Imprinted Gene Browser was developed to visualize the information on imprinted genes in a genomic context. In addition, an Epigenetic Changes Analysis Tool is provided for online analysis of DNA methylation and histone modification differences of imprinted genes among multiple tissues and cell types. MetaImprint provides a comprehensive information repository of imprinted genes, allowing researchers to investigate systematically the genetic and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of imprinted genes and their functions in development and diseases.},

Applying ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, TCS and TCC concentrations were measured in maternal and fetal sera. Significantly increased levels of TCS were detected in maternal sera from mothers with abnormal births. Similar levels of TCS or TCC were found in maternal and cord sera in control group. The concentrations of TCS or TCC in maternal sera correlated with those in umbilical cord sera (r=0.649, P{$<$}0.01).

  abstract = {The heterotrimeric G protein G(s) couples hormone receptors (as well as other receptors) to the effector enzyme adenylyl cyclase and is therefore required for hormone-stimulated intracellular cAMP generation. Receptors activate G(s) by promoting exchange of GTP for GDP on the G(s) alpha-subunit (G(s)alpha) while an intrinsic GTPase activity of G(s)alpha that hydrolyzes bound GTP to GDP leads to deactivation. Mutations of specific G(s)alpha residues (Arg(201) or Gln(227)) that are critical for the GTPase reaction lead to constitutive activation of G(s)-coupled signaling pathways, and such somatic mutations are found in endocrine tumors, fibrous dysplasia of bone, and the McCune-Albright syndrome. Conversely, heterozygous loss-of-function mutations may lead to Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO), a disease characterized by short stature, obesity, brachydactyly, sc ossifications, and mental deficits. Similar mutations are also associated with progressive osseous heteroplasia. Interestingly, paternal transmission of GNAS1 mutations leads to the AHO phenotype alone (pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism), while maternal transmission leads to AHO plus resistance to several hormones (e.g., PTH, TSH) that activate G(s) in their target tissues (pseudohypoparathyroidism type IA). Studies in G(s)alpha knockout mice demonstrate that G(s)alpha is imprinted in a tissue-specific manner, being expressed primarily from the maternal allele in some tissues (e.g., renal proximal tubule, the major site of renal PTH action), while being biallelically expressed in most other tissues. Disrupting mutations in the maternal allele lead to loss of G(s)alpha expression in proximal tubules and therefore loss of PTH action in the kidney, while mutations in the paternal allele have little effect on G(s)alpha expression or PTH action. G(s)alpha has recently been shown to be also imprinted in human pituitary glands. The G(s)alpha gene GNAS1 (as well as its murine ortholog Gnas) has at least four alternative promoters and first exons, leading to the production of alternative gene products including G(s)alpha, XLalphas (a novel G(s)alpha isoform that is expressed only from the paternal allele), and NESP55 (a chromogranin-like protein that is expressed only from the maternal allele). A fourth alternative promoter and first exon (exon 1A) located approximately 2.5 kb upstream of the G(s)alpha promoter is normally methylated on the maternal allele and transcriptionally active on the paternal allele. In patients with isolated renal resistance to PTH (pseudohypoparathyroidism type IB), the exon 1A promoter region has a paternal-specific imprinting pattern on both alleles (unmethylated, transcriptionally active), suggesting that this region is critical for the tissue-specific imprinting of G(s)alpha. The GNAS1 imprinting defect in pseudohypoparathyroidism type IB is predicted to decrease G(s)alpha expression in renal proximal tubules. Studies in G(s)alpha knockout mice also demonstrate that this gene is critical in the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism.},

  abstract = {Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon affecting a small number of genes which leads to differential expression from the two parental alleles. Imprinted genes are known to regulate fetal growth and a `kinship' or `parental conflict' model predicts that paternally- and maternally-expressed imprinted genes promote and inhibit fetal growth, respectively. In this review we examine the role of imprinted genes in postnatal growth and metabolism, with an emphasis on the GNAS/Gnas locus. GNAS is a complex imprinted locus with multiple oppositely imprinted gene products, including the G protein {$\alpha$}-subunit Gs{$\alpha$} which is expressed primarily from the maternal allele in some tissues and the Gs{$\alpha$} isoform XL{$\alpha$}s which is expressed only from the paternal allele. Maternal, but not paternal, Gs{$\alpha$} mutations lead to obesity in Albright hereditary osteodystrophy. Mouse studies show that this phenomenon is due to Gs{$\alpha$} imprinting in the central nervous system leading to a specific defect in the ability of central melanocortins to stimulate sympathetic nervous system activity and energy expenditure. In contrast mutation of paternally-expressed XL{$\alpha$}s leads to opposite metabolic effects in mice. While these findings conform to the `kinship' model, the effects of other imprinted genes on body weight regulation do not conform to this model.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Triclosan (TCS) is an antibacterial agent commonly added to personal care products. Some animal research studies have associated TCS exposure with androgenic and thyroid effects, as well as endocrine disruption, contact dermatitis and skin irritation. Limited Canadian data exist on exposure levels, temporal variability and sources of exposure to TCS, especially among pregnant women. METHODS: Single and serial spot urine samples (n=1249), as well as consumer product use information were collected over 5 study visits across pregnancy and post-partum from 80 healthy pregnant women in Ottawa, Canada. Urine samples were analyzed for TCS by GC-MS-MS. Summary statistics, linear mixed effects models, and surrogate category analysis were used to describe the results. RESULTS: Triclosan was detected in 87\% of maternal urine samples (LOD=3.0{$\mu$}g/L). The geometric mean TCS concentration of all urine samples was 21.6{$\mu$}g/L (95\% CI 18.2-25.7). Triclosan concentrations were significantly higher when the urine was collected before 16:00, in the autumn, and more than 90min since last void, and in nulliparous women with household incomes greater than \$100,000. A significant correlation was observed between maternal urinary TCS concentrations and number of reported uses of TCS-containing products. The ability of a single spot urine sample collected at any time during or post-pregnancy to predict an individual's geometric mean urinary TCS level corresponding to low, medium, or high exposure was 86.7\%. Intraclass correlation coefficients indicated high reproducibility within a week-day (0.77) and week-end day (0.79) and moderate reproducibility across the study period (0.50). CONCLUSIONS: This study provided the first data on temporal variability of urinary TCS concentrations and predictors of exposure in Canadian pregnant women. These results can inform exposure assessments in pregnant women and justify collection of single spot urine samples in epidemiologic studies, especially for women with higher exposures.},

  abstract = {Methods have been developed by several authors to address the problem of bias in regression coefficients due to errors in exposure measurement. These approaches typically assume that there is one surrogate for each exposure. Occupational exposures are quite complex and are often described by characteristics of the workplace and the amount of time that one has worked in a particular area. In this setting, there are several surrogates which are used to define an individual's exposure. To analyze this type of data, regression calibration methodology is extended to adjust the estimates of exposure-response associations for the bias and additional uncertainty due to exposure measurement error from multiple surrogates. The health outcome is assumed to be binary and related to the quantitative measure of exposure by a logistic link function. The model for the conditional mean of the quantitative exposure measurement in relation to job characteristics is assumed to be linear. This approach is applied to a cross-sectional epidemiologic study of lung function in relation to metal working fluid exposure and the corresponding exposure assessment study with quantitative measurements from personal monitors. A simulation study investigates the performance of the proposed estimator for various values of the baseline prevalence of disease, exposure effect and measurement error variance. The efficiency of the proposed estimator relative to the one proposed by Carroll et al. [1995. Measurement Error in Nonlinear Models. Chapman \& Hall, New York] is evaluated numerically for the motivating example. User-friendly and fully documented Splus and SAS routines implementing these methods are available (http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/faculty/spiegelman/multsurr.html).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research suggests that prenatal phthalate exposures affect child executive function and behavior. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated associations between phthalate metabolite concentrations in maternal prenatal urine and mental, motor, and behavioral development in children at 3 years of age. METHODS: Mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), monoisobutyl phthalate (MiBP), and four di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate metabolites were measured in a spot urine sample collected from 319 women during the third trimester. When children were 3 years of age, the Mental Development Index (MDI) and Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) were measured using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II, and behavior problems were assessed by maternal report on the Child Behavior Checklist. RESULTS: Child PDI scores decreased with increasing loge MnBP [estimated adjusted {$\beta$}-coefficient = -2.81; 95\% confidence interval (CI): -4.63, -1.0] and loge MiBP ({$\beta$} = -2.28; 95\% CI: -3.90, -0.67); odds of motor delay increased significantly [per loge MnBP: estimated adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.64; 95\% CI: 1.10, 2.44; per loge MiBP: adjusted OR =1.82; 95\% CI: 1.24, 2.66]. In girls, MDI scores decreased with increasing loge MnBP ({$\beta$} = -2.67; 95\% CI: -4.70, -0.65); the child sex difference in odds of mental delay was significant (p = 0.037). The ORs for clinically withdrawn behavior were 2.23 (95\% CI: 1.27, 3.92) and 1.57 (95\% CI: 1.07, 2.31) per loge unit increase in MnBP and MBzP, respectively; for clinically internalizing behaviors, the OR was 1.43 (95\% CI: 1.01, 1.90) per loge unit increase in MBzP. Significant child sex differences were seen in associations between MnBP and MBzP and behaviors in internalizing domains (p {$<$} 0.05). CONCLUSION: Certain prenatal phthalate exposures may decrease child mental and motor development and increase internalizing behaviors.},

  abstract = {Despite recent evidence that 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) possesses roles in gene regulation distinct from 5-methylcytosine (5mC), relatively little is known regarding the functions of 5hmC in mammalian tissues. To address this issue, we utilized an approach combining both paired bisulfite (BS) and oxidative bisulfite (oxBS) DNA treatment, to resolve genome-wide patterns of 5hmC and 5mC in normal breast tissue from disease-free women. Although less abundant than 5mC, 5hmC was differentially distributed, and consistently enriched among breast-specific enhancers and transcriptionally active chromatin. In contrast, regulatory regions associated with transcriptional inactivity, such as heterochromatin and repressed Polycomb regions, were relatively depleted of 5hmC. Gene regions containing abundant 5hmC were significantly associated with lactate oxidation, immune cell function, and prolactin signaling pathways. Furthermore, genes containing abundant 5hmC were enriched among those actively transcribed in normal breast tissue. Finally, in independent data sets, normal breast tissue 5hmC was significantly enriched among CpG loci demonstrated to have altered methylation in pre-invasive breast cancer and invasive breast tumors. Primarily, our findings identify genomic loci containing abundant 5hmC in breast tissues and provide a genome-wide map of nucleotide-level 5hmC in normal breast tissue. Additionally, these data suggest 5hmC may participate in gene regulatory programs that are dysregulated during breast-related carcinogenesis.},

As such, placental DNAm profiling may be useful to distinguish pregnancies at risk of developing complications and correlation between DNAm and protein levels in maternal blood may give further evidence for a protein's use as a biomarker. However, few studies investigate all clinical parameters that may influence DNAm and/or protein expression, which can significantly affect the relationship between these measures.},

  abstract = {Placental health is a key component to a successful pregnancy. Placental insufficiency (PI), inadequate nutrient delivery to the fetus, is associated with preeclampsia (PE), a maternal hypertensive disorder, and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), pathologically poor fetal growth. PI is more common in early-onset PE (EOPE) than late-onset PE (LOPE). However, the relationship between these disorders remains unclear. While DNA methylation (DNAm) alterations have been identified in PE and IUGR, these entities can overlap and few studies have analysed them separately. This study aims to utilize DNAm profiling to better understand the underlying placental variation associated with PE and IUGR. Placental samples from a discovery (43 controls, 22 EOPE, 18 LOPE, 11 IUGR) and validation cohort (15 controls, 22 EOPE, 11 LOPE) were evaluated using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 array. To account for gestational age (GA) effects, EOPE samples were compared with pre-term births of varying etiologies (GA\,{$<$}37 weeks). LOPE and IUGR were compared with term controls (GA\,{$>$}37 weeks). While 1703 sites were differentially methylated (DM) (FDR\,{$<$}\,0.05, {$\Delta\beta$}\,{$>$}\,0.1) in EOPE, few changes were associated with LOPE (N\,=\,5), or IUGR (N\,=\,0). Of the 1703 EOPE sites, 599 validated in the second cohort. Using these 599 sites, both cohorts clustered into three distinct groups. Interestingly, LOPE samples diagnosed between 34 and 36 weeks with co-occurring IUGR clustered with the EOPE. DNAm profiling may provide an independent tool to refine clinical/pathological diagnoses into subgroups with more uniform pathology. Despite large changes observed in EOPE, there were challenges in reproducing genome-wide DNAm hits that are discussed.},

  abstract = {Alteration of cancer cell toward mesenchymal phenotype has been shown to potentiate tumor aggressiveness by increasing cancer cell metastasis. Herein, we report the effect of triclosan, a widely used antibacterial agent found in many daily products, in enhancing the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in aggressive anoikis resistant human H460 lung cancer cells. EMT has been long known to increase abilities of the cells to increase migration, invasion, and survival in circulating system. The present study reveals that treatment of the cancer cells with triclosan at the physiologically related concentrations significantly increased the colony number of the cancer cells assessed by tumor formation assay. Also, the mesenchymal-like morphology and decrease in cell-to-cell adhesion were observed in triclosan-treated cells. Importantly, western blot analysis revealed that triclosan-treated cells exhibited decreased E-cadherin, while the levels of EMT markers, namely N-cadherin, vimentin, snail and slug were found to be significantly up-regulated. Furthermore, EMT induced by triclosan treatment was accompanied by the activation of focal adhesion kinase/ATP dependent tyrosine kinase (FAK/Akt) and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1), which enhanced the ability of the cells to migrate and invade. In conclusion, we demonstrated for the first time that triclosan may potentiate cancer cells survival in detached condition and motility via the process of EMT. As mentioned capabilities are required for success in metastasis, the present study provides the novel toxicological information and encourages the awareness of triclosan use in cancer patients.},

Neutrophil-primed progenitor genes and a MYC transcription factor regulome were prominent in stem cells from CMML-1 patients, whereas CMML-2 stem cells exhibited strong expression of interferon-regulatory factor regulomes, including those associated with IRF1, IRF7 and IRF8. CMML-1 and CMML-2 stem cells (stages distinguished by proportion of downstream blasts and promonocytes) differed substantially in both transcriptome and pseudotime, indicating fundamentally different biology underpinning these disease states.

  abstract = {Benzophenone-3 (BP-3) is the most widely used compound among UV filters for the prevention of photodegradation. Population studies have demonstrated that it penetrates through the skin and crosses the blood-brain barrier. However, little is known about the impact of BP-3 on the nervous system and its possible adverse effects on the developing brain. We demonstrated that the neurotoxic effects of BP-3 were accompanied by the induction of apoptosis, as evidenced by apoptosis-related caspase-3 activation and apoptotic body formation as well as the inhibition of autophagy, as determined by the downregulation of autophagy-related genes, decreased autophagosome formation, and reduced LC3B-to-LC3A ratio. In this study, we showed for the first time that the BP-3-induced apoptosis of neuronal cells is mediated via the stimulation of RXR{$\alpha$} signaling and the attenuation of RXR{$\beta$}/RXR{$\gamma$} signaling, as demonstrated using selective antagonist and specific siRNAs as well as by measuring the mRNA and protein expression levels of the receptors. This study also demonstrated that environmentally relevant concentrations of BP-3 were able to inhibit autophagy and disrupt the epigenetic status of neuronal cells, as evidenced by the inhibition of global DNA methylation as well as the reduction of histone deacetylases and histone acetyl transferases activity, which may increase the risks of neurodevelopmental abnormalities and/or neural degenerations.},

  abstract = {Current evidence indicates that benzophenone-3 (BP-3) can pass through the placental and blood\textendash brain barriers and thus can likely affect infant neurodevelopment. Despite widespread exposure, data showing the effects of BP-3 on the developing nervous system are scarce. This study revealed for the first time that prenatal exposure to BP-3 led to apoptosis and neurotoxicity, altered the levels of estrogen receptors (ERs) and changed the epigenetic status of mouse neurons. In the present study, subcutaneous injections of pregnant mice with BP-3 at 50 mg/kg, which is an environmentally relevant dose, evoked activation of caspase-3 and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release as well as substantial loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in neocortical cells of their embryonic offspring. Apoptosis-focused microarray analysis of neocortical cells revealed up-regulation of 22 genes involved in apoptotic cell death. This effect was supported by increased BAX and CASP3 mRNA and protein levels, as evidenced by qPCR, ELISAs and western blots. BP-3-induced apoptosis and neurotoxicity were accompanied by decreases in the mRNA and protein expression levels of ESR1 and ESR2 (also known as ER{$\alpha$} and ER{$\beta$}), with a simultaneous increase in GPER1 (also known as GPR30) expression. In addition to the demonstration that treatment of pregnant mice with BP-3 induced apoptosis, caused neurotoxicity and altered ERs expression levels in neocortical cells of their embryonic offspring, we showed that prenatal administration of BP-3 inhibited global DNA methylation as well as reduced DNMTs activity. BP-3 also caused specific hypomethylation of the genes Gper1 and Bax, an effect that was accompanied by increased mRNA and protein expression levels. In addition, BP-3 caused hypermethylation of the genes Esr1, Esr2 and Bcl2, which could explain the reduced mRNA and protein levels of the estrogen receptors. This study demonstrated for the first time that prenatal exposure to BP-3 caused severe neuronal apoptosis that was accompanied by impaired ESR1/ESR2 expression, enhanced GPER1 expression, global DNA hypomethylation and altered methylation statuses of apoptosis-related and ERs genes. We suggest that the effects of BP-3 in embryonic neurons may be the fetal basis of the adult onset of nervous system disease.},

Despite that BP-3 exposure is widespread, knowledge about the impact of BP-3 on the brain development is negligible. The present study aimed to explore the mechanisms of prenatal exposure to BP-3 in neuronal cells, with particular emphasis on autophagy and nuclear receptors signaling as well as the epigenetic and post-translational modifications occurring in response to BP-3. To observe the impact of prenatal exposure to BP-3, we administered BP-3 to pregnant mice, and next, we isolated brain tissue from pretreated embryos for primary cell~neocortical culture. Our study revealed that prenatal exposure to BP-3 (used in environmentally relevant doses) impairs autophagy in terms of BECLIN-1, MAP1LC3B, autophagosomes, and autophagy-related factors; disrupts the levels of retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR{$\gamma$}); alters epigenetic status (i.e., attenuates HDAC and sirtuin activities); inhibits post-translational modifications in terms of global sumoylation; and dysregulates expression of neurogenesis- and neurotransmitter-related genes as well as miRNAs involved in pathologies of the nervous system. Our study also showed that BP-3 has good permeability through the BBB. We strongly suggest that BP-3-evoked effects may substantiate a fetal basis of the adult onset of neurological diseases, particularly schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many phthalates and phenols are hormonally active and are suspected to alter the course of development. OBJECTIVE: We investigated prenatal exposures to phthalate and phenol metabolites and their associations with body size measures of the infants at birth. METHODS: We measured 5 phenol and 10 phthalate urinary metabolites in a multiethnic cohort of 404 women in New York City during their third trimester of pregnancy and recorded size of infants at birth. RESULTS: Median urinary concentrations were {$>$} 10 \textmu g/L for 2 of 5 phenols and 6 of 10 phthalate monoester metabolites. Concentrations of low-molecular-weight phthalate monoesters (low-MWP) were approximately 5-fold greater than those of high-molecular-weight metabolites. Low-MWP metabolites had a positive association with gestational age [0.97 day gestational age per ln-biomarker; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.07\textendash 1.9 days, multivariate adjusted] and with head circumference. Higher prenatal exposures to 2,5-dichlorophenol (2,5-DCP) predicted lower birth weight in boys (\textendash 210 g average birth weight difference between the third tertile and first tertile of 2,5-DCP; 95\% CI, 71\textendash 348 g). Higher maternal benzophenone-3 (BP3) concentrations were associated with a similar decrease in birth weight among girls but with greater birth weight in boys. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a range of phthalate and phenol exposures during pregnancy in our population, but few were associated with birth size. The association of 2,5-DCP and BP3 with reduced or increased birth weight could be important in very early or small-size births. In addition, positive associations of urinary metabolites with some outcomes may be attributable partly to unresolved confounding with maternal anthropometric factors.},

We have examined the methylation of APC gene promoters in human placenta and choriocarcinoma cells. This revealed a general hypomethylation of the APC-1b promoter and a pattern with monoallelic methylation of the APC-1a promoter in full term placental tissue. However, there was no evidence of a parent-of-origin effect, suggesting random post zygotic origin of methylation. Increased methylation of this promoter was observed in all choriocarcinoma-derived trophoblast cell lines, suggesting a trophoblastic origin of placental APC methylation and implicating APC hypermethylation in the development of this group of gestational tumours. Our demonstration of placental methylation of the APC-1a promoter represents the first observation of monoallelic methylation of this gene in early development, and provides further support for a role of canonical Wnt signalling in placental trophoblast invasiveness. This also implicates tumour suppressor gene silencing as an integral part of normal human placental development.},

  abstract = {Multiple imputation is a popular technique for analysing incomplete data. Given the imputed data and a particular model, Rubin's rules (RR) for estimating parameters and standard errors are well established. However, there are currently no guidelines for variable selection in multiply imputed data sets. The usual practice is to perform variable selection amongst the complete cases, a simple but inefficient and potentially biased procedure. Alternatively, variable selection can be performed by repeated use of RR, which is more computationally demanding. An approximation can be obtained by a simple `stacked' method that combines the multiply imputed data sets into one and uses a weighting scheme to account for the fraction of missing data in each covariate. We compare these and other approaches using simulations based around a trial in community psychiatry. Most methods improve on the na\textasciidieresis\i ve complete-case analysis for variable selection, but importantly the type 1 error is only preserved if selection is based on RR, which is our recommended approach.

A pilot study conducted in three provinces in Thailand measured maternal urinary metabolites of OP pesticides in pregnant women at 7~months gestation and at birth. Within 3~days of birth, 82 newborns underwent neurobehavioral testing using the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS). Comparison of the NBAS test results with maternal OP metabolite levels found the neonates NBAS Habituation cluster score increased with maternal dimethylphosphate (DMP) levels (p~=~0.04) while the Range of State score increased with total diethylphosphate (DEP) levels (p~=~0.01). The Number of Abnormal Reflexes in the neonate also increased as maternal urinary total DEP levels increased (p~=~0.06). These preliminary findings suggest that pre-natal exposures to OP pesticides can impact newborn neurodevelopment and support the need for a longitudinal evaluation of childhood neurodevelopment in relation to pesticide exposures in Thailand.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: One challenge facing biologists is to tease out useful information from massive data sets for further analysis. A pathway-based analysis may shed light by projecting candidate genes onto protein functional relationship networks. We are building such a pathway-based analysis system. RESULTS: We have constructed a protein functional interaction network by extending curated pathways with non-curated sources of information, including protein-protein interactions, gene coexpression, protein domain interaction, Gene Ontology (GO) annotations and text-mined protein interactions, which cover close to 50\% of the human proteome. By applying this network to two glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) data sets and projecting cancer candidate genes onto the network, we found that the majority of GBM candidate genes form a cluster and are closer than expected by chance, and the majority of GBM samples have sequence-altered genes in two network modules, one mainly comprising genes whose products are localized in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, and another comprising gene products in the nucleus. Both modules are highly enriched in known oncogenes, tumor suppressors and genes involved in signal transduction. Similar network patterns were also found in breast, colorectal and pancreatic cancers. CONCLUSIONS: We have built a highly reliable functional interaction network upon expert-curated pathways and applied this network to the analysis of two genome-wide GBM and several other cancer data sets. The network patterns revealed from our results suggest common mechanisms in the cancer biology. Our system should provide a foundation for a network or pathway-based analysis platform for cancer and other diseases.},

  abstract = {Normalization has been recognized as a necessary preprocessing step in a variety of high-throughput biotechnologies. A number of normalization methods have been developed specifically for microarrays, some general and others tailored for certain experimental designs. All methods rely on assumptions about data characteristics that are expected to stay constant across samples, although some make it more explicit than others. Most methods make assumptions that certain quantities related to the biological signal of interest stay the same; this is reasonable for many experiments but usually not verifiable. Recently, several platforms have begun to include a large number of negative control probes that nonetheless cover nearly the entire range of the measured signal intensity. Using these probes as a normalization basis makes it possible to normalize without making assumptions about the behavior of the biological signal. We present a subset quantile normalization (SQN) procedure that normalizes based on the distribution of non-specific control features, without restriction on the behavior of specific signals. We illustrate the performance of this method using three different platforms and experimental settings. Compared to two other leading nonlinear normalization procedures, the SQN method preserves more biological variation after normalization while reducing the noise observed on control features. Although the illustration datasets are from microarray experiments, this method is general for all high throughput technologies that include a large set of control features that have constant expectations across samples. It does not require an equal number of features in all samples and tolerates missing data. Supplementary Material is available online at www.liebertonline.com.},

RESULTS: The proportion of cytosines with 5-mC methylation in LNCaP cells was significantly decreased by MEHP (1, 5, 10, and 25 {$\mu$}mol/L) in a dose-dependent manner (P {$<$} 0.01). For genes in the Hedgehog pathway, there was no significant MEHP concentration-dependent difference in the DNA methylation of PTCH and SMO.

Human data concerning repeated measurements of TCS throughout pregnancy in relation to fetal and childhood growth are sparse. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the associations between multiple measurements of maternal urinary concentrations of TCS during pregnancy and fetal and early-childhood growth. METHODS: The study population included 850 mother-infant pairs who participated in a prenatal cohort established between 2014 and 2015 in Wuhan. Prenatal TCS exposure was measured in a complete series of urine samples collected at the first, second and third trimesters. General linear models and generalized estimating equation models were applied to evaluate the associations of the averaged maternal urinary concentrations of TCS over trimesters and trimester-specific urinary TCS with the z-scores of estimated fetal weight, head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur length at 16, 24, and 31 gestational weeks, weight and length at birth, and weight and height at 0.5, 1, and 2 years of age. RESULTS: In overall infants, we did not observe any significant association of the averaged maternal urinary concentrations of TCS over trimesters with ultrasound parameters and size at birth. However, a positive association of borderline statistical significance was found between averaged prenatal TCS exposure and the third-trimester estimated fetal weight z-score in girls in sex-stratified analyses ({$\beta$} = 0.054, 95\% CI: -0.005, 0.113, p = 0.07). Moreover, averaged prenatal TCS exposure was positively associated with 2 year-old weight z-score among total infants ({$\beta$} = 0.046, 95\% CI: 0.005, 0.087). After stratifying by sex, the same association was observed in girls with more prominent estimation ({$\beta$} = 0.062, 95\% CI: 0.000, 0.124), whereas the association weakened and became not significant in boys ({$\beta$} = 0.033, 95\% CI: -0.024, 0.089). TCS exposure at 1st and 2nd-trimester were positively associated with weight z-score at 2 years, in both overall and female infants. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal exposure to triclosan was associated with elevated third-trimester estimated fetal weight and 2 year-old weight z-score in girls, and the early and middle stage of pregnancy may be the windows of vulnerability.

To date, few epidemiological studies regarding repeated paraben measurements during pregnancy associated with fetal and childhood growth have been conducted. Within a Chinese prenatal cohort, 850 mother-infant pairs from whom a complete set of maternal urine samples were acquired during three trimesters were included, and the levels of five parabens were measured. We assessed the associations of both average and trimester-specific urinary paraben levels with weight and height z-scores at birth, 6 months, 1, and 2 years of age. In all infants, each doubling increase in average ethyl paraben (EtP) was associated with -2.82\% (95\% CI: -5.11\%, -0.53\%) decrease in weight z-score at birth, whereas no significant age-specific associations were identified. After stratifying by sex, we further observed age-specific association of average EtP with -3.96\% (95\% CI: -7.03\%, -0.89\%) and -3.38\% (95\% CI: 6.72\%, -0.03\%) reduction in weight z-scores at 1 and 2 years in males, respectively. Third-trimester EtP was negatively associated with weight z-scores at birth, 1 and 2 years in males. Our results suggested negative associations between prenatal paraben exposure and fetal and childhood growth, and the third trimester may be the window of susceptibility.},

  abstract = {Di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP) is a widely used plasticizer and ubiquitous environmental contaminant. The potential health hazards, including teratogenicity, from exposure to DEHP may be related to the role of DEHP or its metabolites in the trans-activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Fetal essential fatty acid (EFA) homeostasis is controlled by directional transfer across the placenta through a highly regulated process, including PPAR activation. Using HRP-1 rat trophoblastic cells, the effects of DEHP and two of its metabolites, mono-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (MEHP) and 2-ethylhexanoic acid (EHA), on the mRNA and protein expression of the three known PPAR isoforms (alpha, beta, and gamma), fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1), plasma membrane fatty acid binding protein (FABPpm), and the heart cytoplasmic fatty acid binding protein (HFABP) were investigated. This study also investigated the functional effects of exposure on the uptake and transport of six long chain fatty acids (LCFAs): arachidonic acid (AA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), linoleic acid (LA), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), oleic acid (OA), and stearic acid (SA). In the presence of DEHP, MEHP, and EHA, the expression of PPARalpha, PPARgamma, FATP1, and HFABP were up-regulated in a dose- and time- dependent manner, while PPARbeta and FABPpm demonstrated variable expression. The uptake rates of EFAs (AA, DHA, LA, ALA) increased significantly upon exposure, and the transport of AA (omega-6) and DHA (omega-3) were directionally induced. These results suggest that DEHP, MEHP, and EHA can influence EFA transfer across HRP-1 cells, implying that these compounds may alter placental EFA homeostasis and potentially result in abnormal fetal development.},

  abstract = {The highly directional maternal-to-fetal transfer of essential fatty acids (EFAs) across the placenta plays a critical role in guiding proper fetal development. Exposure to xenobiotics that may alter the fetal supply of EFAs/lipids could lead to fetal toxicity. Since the placenta is the first fetal arising organ that regulates fetal fatty acid homeostasis, the fatty acid/lipid composition in the placenta may serve as an indicator of fetal composition. In this study, we investigated the effects of the peroxisome proliferator chemical di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP), a widely used plasticizer and ubiquitous environmental contaminant, and its selective metabolites, mono-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (MEHP) and 2-ethylhexanoic acid (EHA) on the lipid metabolome in a rat HRP-1 trophoblast model. The concentrations of ten lipid classes (cholesterol esters, diacylglycerol, triacylglycerides, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, lysophosphatidylcholine, cardiolipin, and sphingomyelin) were determined, as well as the individual fatty acid compositions, especially the omega-3 and omega-6 family of EFAs. The level of each lipid class was significantly increased upon exposure to the agents, with MEHP and EHA generally showing higher increases than DEHP. The same trends were observed in comparing the fatty acid compositions. For example, the omega-3/omega-6 fatty acids ratio did not change, although the levels of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids were significantly elevated upon exposure. These results suggest that DEHP and its metabolites can alter lipid metabolome in a rat placental cell line, implying that these compounds may contribute to aberrant placental EFA/lipid homeostasis caused by peroxisome proliferation, and potentially result in abnormal fetal development.},

We recruited 284 healthy pregnant women, of whom 262 provided both cord blood and placenta samples, and 200 had all measurements taken. Placental Cd, cord blood BPA and total PCBs in the exposed group were higher than a reference group. KISS1 expression level in placental tissue was threefold higher in the exposed group than in the reference, and was positively associated with all toxicants. Leptin and leptin receptor expression were also significantly higher, but were only associated with BPA. From our findings, we conclude that lower birth weight is correlated with Cd and PCBs, and may result from the increased KISS1 mRNA expression.},

Appropriate data preprocessing to remove background noise is important for detecting the small changes that may be associated with disease. We developed a novel background correction method, ENmix, that uses a mixture of exponential and truncated normal distributions to flexibly model signal intensity and uses a truncated normal distribution to model background noise. Depending on data availability, we employ three approaches to estimate background normal distribution parameters using (i) internal chip negative controls, (ii) out-of-band Infinium I probe intensities or (iii) combined methylated and unmethylated intensities. We evaluate ENmix against other available methods for both reproducibility among duplicate samples and accuracy of methylation measurement among laboratory control samples. ENmix out-performed other background correction methods for both these measures and substantially reduced the probe-design type bias between Infinium I and II probes. In reanalysis of existing EWAS data we show that ENmix can identify additional CpGs, and results in smaller P-value estimates for previously-validated CpGs. We incorporated the method into R package ENmix, which is freely available from Bioconductor website.},

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying maternal Cd toxicity on fetal growth remain largely unknown. Specifically, the expression profiles and the regulation mechanisms of the imprinted genes, have been poorly characterized in the etiology of Cd-induced fetal growth restriction (FGR). In the present study, 13 imprinted genes associated with the fetal growth and placenta development were selected and their expression patterns were examined in the Cd-exposed placentas. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blot results showed that the maternally expressed gene, Cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1c (Cdkn1c), and paternally expressed gene, Paternally expressed gene 10 (Peg10), were significantly upregulated and downregulated respectively in the Cd-exposed placentas when compared to the normal ones respectively. Moreover, data from bisulfate PCR demonstrated the changes of the methylation levels of the promoter regions of Cdkn1c and Peg10 in the Cd-exposed placentas. In addition, the expression profile of Cdkn1c was correlated with the methylation levels of site 2 (-837--692) but not site 1 (-389--185) of its promoter region. Therefore, our results suggest that changes of the DNA methylation levels of the promoter regions and the expression patterns of Cdkn1c and Peg10 may be involved in the etiology of Cd-induced fetal growth restriction.},

  abstract = {Background: H19 and IGF2 genes are imprinted and involved in regulating fetal and placental growth. The H19 differentially methylated region (DMR) is paternally methylated and maternally unmethylated and regulates the imprinted expression of H19 and IGF2. Epimutation at the H19-DMR in humans results in congenital growth disorders, Beckwith-Wiedemann and Silver-Russell syndromes, when erroneously its maternal allele becomes methylated and its paternal allele becomes unmethylated, respectively. Although H19 and IGF2 have been assessed for their involvement in pregnancy complications including fetal growth restriction (FGR) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH)/ hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (HDP) intensively in the last decade, it is still not established whether epimutation at the H19-DMR in the placenta results in pathogenic conditions in pregnancy. We aimed to assess the frequency of H19-DMR epimutation and its effects on the allelic expression patterns of H19 and IGF2 genes among normal and abnormal pregnancy cases. Results: We enrolled two independently collected sets of placenta samples from normal pregnancies as controls and common pregnancy complications, FGR and PIH (HDP). The first set consisted of 39 controls and 140 FGR and/or PIH cases, and the second set consisted of 29 controls and 62 cases. For these samples, we initially screened for DNA methylation changes at H19-DMR and IGF2-DMRs by combined bisulfite restriction analysis, and further analyzed cases with methylation changes for their allelic methylation and expression patterns. We identified one case each of FGR and PIH showing hypomethylation of H19-DMR and IGF2-DMRs only in the placenta, but not in cord blood, from the first case/control set. For the PIH case, we were able to determine the allelic expression pattern of H19 to be biallelically expressed and the H19/IGF2 expression ratio to be highly elevated compared to controls. We also identified a PIH case with hypomethylation at H19-DMR and IGF2-DMRs in the placenta from the second case/control set. Conclusions: Placental epimutation at H19-DMR was observed among common pregnancy complication cases at the frequency of 1.5\% (3 out of 202 cases examined), but not in 68 normal pregnancy cases examined. Alteration of H19/IGF2 expression patterns due to hypomethylation of H19-DMR may have been involved in the pathogenesis of pregnancy complications in these cases.},

The results of ethological analysis (elevated plus maze test and open-field test), histopathological examination of the brain, and assessments of oxidative stress (OS) in the mouse brain showed that there is a link between oxidative stress and anxiety-like behavior produced by DBP at higher doses (25 or 125mg/kg/day).

To minimize the impact of batch effects, an ideal experiment design should ensure the even distribution of biological groups and confounding factors across batches. However, due to the practical complications, the availability of the final collection of samples in genomics study might be unbalanced and incomplete, which, without appropriate attention in sample-to-batch allocation, could lead to drastic batch effects. Therefore, it is necessary to develop effective and handy tool to assign collected samples across batches in an appropriate way in order to minimize the impact of batch effects. Results: We describe OSAT (Optimal Sample Assignment Tool), a bioconductor package designed for automated sample-to-batch allocations in genomics experiments. Conclusions: OSAT is developed to facilitate the allocation of collected samples to different batches in genomics study. Through optimizing the even distribution of samples in groups of biological interest into different batches, it can reduce the confounding or correlation between batches and the biological variables of interest. It can also optimize the homogeneous distribution of confounding factors across batches. It can handle challenging instances where incomplete and unbalanced sample collections are involved as well as ideally balanced designs.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bisphenol A (BPA) is a ubiquitous endocrine disrupting chemical in our daily life, and its health effect in response to prenatal exposure is still controversial. Early-life BPA exposure may impact brain development and contribute to childhood neurological disorders. The aim of the present study was to investigate molecular target genes of neuronal development in trans-placental exposure to BPA. METHODOLOGY: A meta-analysis of three public microarray datasets was performed to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in exposure to BPA. The candidate genes of neuronal development were identified from gene ontology analysis in a reconstructed neuronal sub-network, and their gene expressions were determined using real-time PCR in 20 umbilical cord blood samples dichotomized into high and low BPA level groups upon the median 16.8 nM. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Among 36 neuronal transcripts sorted from DAVID ontology clusters of 457 DEGs using the analysis of Bioconductor limma package, we found two neuronal genes, sex determining region Y-box 2 (Sox2) and paired box 6 (Pax6), had preferentially down-regulated expression (Bonferroni correction p-value {$<$}10(-4) and log2-transformed fold change {$\leq$}-1.2) in response to BPA exposure. Fetal cord blood samples had the obviously attenuated gene expression of Sox2 and Pax6 in high BPA group referred to low BPA group. Visualized gene network of Cytoscape analysis showed that Sox2 and Pax6 which were contributed to neural precursor cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation might be down-regulated through sonic hedgehog (Shh), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and Notch signaling. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that trans-placental BPA exposure down-regulated gene expression of Sox2 and Pax6 potentially underlying the adverse effect on childhood neuronal development.},

The PCR product, which represents a pool of approximately 15 000 genomic loci, could be used for direct sequencing, selective restriction digestion or pyrosequencing, in order to quantitate DNA methylation. By restriction digestion or pyrosequencing, the assay was reproducible with a standard deviation of only 2\% between assays. Using this method we found that almost two-thirds of the CpG methylation sites in Alu elements are mutated, but of the remaining methylation target sites, 87\% were methylated. Due to the heavy methylation of repetitive elements, this assay was especially useful in detecting decreases in DNA methylation, and this assay was validated by examining cell lines treated with the methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2\textcent deoxycytidine (DAC), where we found a 1{$\pm$}16\% decrease in Alu element and 18{$\pm$}60\% LINE methylation within 3 days of treatment. This method can be used as a surrogate marker of genome-wide methylation changes. In addition, it is less labor intensive and requires less DNA than previous methods of assessing global DNA methylation.},

Since bisphenol~A (BPA) and phthalates are epigenetically toxic, the purpose of this study was to examine whether BPA and phthalate metabolites, including monoethyl phthalate~(MEP), mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP), mono-isobutyl phthalate~(MIBP), mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate~(MEHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP), and mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), have an epigenetic impact on ADAM33 and the incidence of breast cancer. CpG islands of breast cancer microarray~datasets obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were used to assess the ADAM33 methylation profile. We designed a case-control study including 44~cases and 22~age-matched controls to detect the methylation status of intron~1 in ADAM33 from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in blood, using BSP, nested PCR, and bisulfite sequencing, and measured the in vivo gene expression of ADAM33 and the urinary concentrations of endocrine-disrupting chemicals~(EDCs), using real-time PCR, high-performance liquid chromatography~(HPLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry~(LC-MS). Only one dataset, GSE32393, reached significance~(P=0.016). ADAM33 expression and methylation frequencies at CpG site~3 in intron~1 were higher in the control group. We found a positive association between intron~1 methylation level and ADAM33 expression as well as urinary concentrations of MEHHP, MECPP, MEOHP and {$\Sigma$}4MEHP (the sum of MEHP, MECPP, MEHHP, and MEOHP) in the cases. This study suggests that metabolites of phthalate such as MEHHP, MECPP, MEOHP and {$\Sigma$}4MEHP may increase the intron~1 methylation level to elevate ADAM33 gene expression and have a protective effect on reducing the risk of breast cancer.},

  abstract = {Organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) remain one of the most commonly used pesticides, and their detection rates and residues in agricultural products, foods and environmental samples have been underestimated. Humans and environmental organisms are at high risk of exposure to OPs. Most OPs can be degraded and metabolized into dialkyl phosphates (DAPs) in organisms and the environment, and can be present in urine as biomarkers for exposure to OPs, of which diethyl phosphate (DEP) is a high-exposure metabolite. Epidemiological and cohort studies have found that DAPs are associated with endocrine hormone disorders, especially sex hormone disorders and thyroid hormone disorders, but there has been no direct causal evidence to support these findings. Our study explored the effects of chronic exposure to DEP on endocrine hormones and related metabolic indicators in adult male rats at actual doses that can be reached in the human body. The results showed that chronic exposure to DEP could cause thyroid-related hormone disorders in the serum of rats, causing symptoms of hyperthyroidism in rats, and could also lead to abnormal expression of thyroid hormone-related genes in the rat liver. However, DEP exposure did not seem to affect serum sex hormone levels, spermatogenesis or sperm quality in rats. The molecular interactions between DEP and thyroid hormone-related enzymes/proteins were investigated by molecular docking and molecular dynamics methods in silico. It was found that DEP could strongly interact with thyroid hormone biosynthesis, blood transport, receptor binding and metabolism-related enzymes/proteins, interfering with the production and signal regulation of thyroid hormones. In vivo and in silico experiments showed that DEP might be a potential thyroid hormone-disrupting chemical, and therefore, we need to be more cautious and rigorous regarding organophosphorus chemical exposure.},

This study investigated the associations between phthalate exposure during the first trimester and thyroid hormones in pregnant women and their newborns. Pregnant women were enrolled from the prospective Ma'anshan Birth Cohort study in China. A standard questionnaire was completed by the women at the first antenatal visit. Seven phthalate metabolites were measured in one-spot urine at enrolment (10.0 {$\pm$} 2.1 gestational weeks), as were thyroid hormone levels in maternal and cord sera. Multivariable linear regression showed that 1-standard deviation (SD) increase in natural log (ln)-transformed mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) and mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP) was associated with 0.163 mg/dL (p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.001) and 0.173 mg/dL (p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.001) decreases in maternal total thyroxine (TT4). Both MEHP and MEHHP were negatively associated with maternal free thyroxine (FT4; b: \`A0.013, p {$<$} 0.001 and b: \`A0.011, p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.001, respectively) and positively associated with maternal thyroidstimulating hormone (b: 0.101, p {$<$} 0.001; b: 0.132, p {$<$} 0.001, respectively). An inverse association was observed between monobenzyl phthalate and maternal TT4 and FT4. A 1-SD increase in ln-transformed monoethyl phthalate was inversely associated with maternal TT4 (b: \`A0.151, p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.002). By contrast, the concentrations of phthalate metabolites in urine were not associated with those of thyroid hormone in cord serum.

Methods: We compared the concentration of maternal urinary metabolites of bisphenol A and phthalates at two distinct time points in pregnancy (16w, 26w) with scores on the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS) at 5 weeks of age in a cohort of 350 mother/infant pairs. Results: Prenatal exposure to BPA was not significantly associated with neurobehavioral outcomes at 5 weeks. Significant associations between prenatal exposure to measured phthalates and infant neurobehavioral outcomes differed by type of phthalate and were only seen with exposure measured at 26 weeks. Higher total di-butyl phthalate (DBP) metabolites at 26w were associated with improved behavioral organization evidenced by decreased arousal (p= .04), increased self-regulation (p= .052), and decreased handling (p= .02). In males, higher total di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) metabolites at 26w were associated with more nonoptimal reflexes (p= .02). Conclusion: The association between prenatal phthalate exposure and infant neurobehavior differed by type of phthalate and was evident only with exposure measured at 26w. Prenatal exposure to DBP was associated with improved behavioral organization in 5-week-old infants. Prenatal exposure to DEHP was associated with nonoptimal reflexes in male infants. There was no evidence of an association between prenatal BPA exposure and infant neurobehavior.},

Personal exposure concentrations of p-DCB and concentrations of 2,5-DCP excreted in the urine of 119 adults living in Osaka were determined. Airborne p-DCB was collected for 24 h by passive gas sampling tubes packed with charcoal. The tubes were exchanged every 12 h. The sampling was started immediately after the subject woke up in the morning (7 A.M.). The collected p-DCB was desorbed with toluene and measured using a gas chromatograph with an electron capture detector (GC-ECD). On the other hand, the first morning urine samples were collected at the endpoint of airborne p-DCB sampling (7 A.M. the next morning). The urine samples were hydrolyzed with concentrated sulfuric acid. 2,5-DCP in the hydrolysates was extracted with n-hexane and measured by GC-ECD. Both p-DCB and 2,5-DCP were detected in more than 99\% of the air and urine samples, respectively, from the participants. The median of p-DCB exposure concentrations for 24 h was 2.5 ppb, with a maximum concentration of 33.3 ppb. The median of urinary 2,5-DCP concentrations was 0.39 mg/g creatinine, with the maximum concentration of 3.32 mg/g creatinine. The regression line between the urinary 2,5-DCP concentration (y) and the p-DCB exposure concentration (x) was y = 0.080 x + 0.181, with the Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.81 (p {$<$} 0.001), demonstrating a strong association between these measurements. Consequently, urinary 2,5-DCP should be suitable as an index for monitoring low-level exposure of p-DCB in the general population.},

PlaNET's ethnicity classification relies on 1860 HM450K microarray sites, and over half of these were linked to nearby genetic polymorphisms (n = 955). Our placental-optimized method outperforms existing approaches in assessing population stratification in placental samples from individuals of Asian, African, and Caucasian ethnicities.                                   Conclusion                            PlaNET provides an improved approach to address population stratification in placental DNAme association studies. The method can be applied to predict ethnicity as a discrete or continuous variable and will be especially useful when self-reported ethnicity information is missing and genotyping markers are unavailable. PlaNET is available as an R package at (               https://github.com/wvictor14/planet               ).},

Results               The most distinct DNAm profiles were those of placental trophoblasts, which are central to many pregnancy-essential functions, and Hofbauer cells, which are a rare fetal-derived macrophage population. Cell-specific DNAm occurs at functionally-relevant genes, including genes associated with placental development and preeclampsia. Known placental-specific methylation marks, such as those associated with genomic imprinting, repetitive element hypomethylation, and placental partially methylated domains, were found to be more pronounced in trophoblasts and often absent in Hofbauer cells. Lastly, we characterize the cell composition and cell-specific DNAm dynamics across gestation.

Although multiple studies have investigated gene expression changes in these disorders, few studies have examined epigenetic changes. Analysis of the DNA methylation pattern associated with such pregnancies provides an alternative approach to identifying cellular changes involved in these disorders. We analyzed methylation of 1505 CpG sites associated with 807 genes in 26 placentas from early-onset preeclampsia (EOPET), late-onset preeclampsia, IUGR and control subjects using an Illumina GoldenGate Methylation panel. Thirty-four loci were hypomethylated (false discovery rate {$<$}10\% and methylation difference {$>$}10\%) in the early-onset preeclamptic placentas while no and only five differentially methylated loci were found in late-onset preeclamptic and IUGR placentas, respectively. Hypomethylation of 4 loci in EOPET was further confirmed by bisulfite pyrosequencing of 26 independent placental samples. The promoter of TIMP3 was confirmed to be significantly hypomethylated in EOPET placentas (P=0.00001). Our results suggest that gene-specific hypomethylation may be a common phenomenon in EOPET placentas, and that TIMP3 could serve as a potential prenatal diagnostic marker for EOPET.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Development of human tissue is influenced by a combination of intrinsic biological signals and extrinsic environmental stimuli, both of which are mediated by epigenetic regulation, including DNA methylation. However, little is currently known of the normal acquisition or loss of epigenetic markers during fetal and postnatal development. RESULTS: The DNA methylation status of over 1000 CpGs located in the regulatory regions of nearly 800 genes was evaluated in five somatic tissues (brain, kidney, lung, muscle and skin) from eight normal second-trimester fetuses. Tissue-specific differentially methylated regions (tDMRs) were identified in 195 such loci. However, comparison with corresponding data from trisomic fetuses (five trisomy 21 and four trisomy 18) revealed relatively few DNA methylation differences associated with trisomy, despite such conditions having a profound effect on development. Of interest, only 17\% of the identified fetal tDMRs were found to maintain this same tissue-specific DNA methylation in adult tissues. Furthermore, 10\% of the sites analyzed, including sites associated with imprinted genes, had a DNA methylation difference of {$>$}40\% between fetus and adult. This plasticity of DNA methylation over development was further confirmed by comparison with similar data from embryonic stem cells, with the most altered methylation levels being linked to domains with bivalent histone modifications. CONCLUSIONS: Most fetal tDMRs seem to reflect transient DNA methylation changes during development rather than permanent epigenetic signatures. The extensive tissue-specific and developmental-stage specific nature of DNA methylation will need to be elucidated to identify abnormal patterns of DNA methylation associated with abnormal development or disease.},

Previous work showed high-dose TCS (1.25\textendash 10 {$\mu$}M) induced global DNA hypomethylation in HepG2 cells. However, whether or how tumor suppressor gene methylation changed in HepG2 cells after low-dose and long-term TCS exposure is still unknown. We investigate here the effects and mechanisms of DNA methylation of global DNA(GDM), repetitive genes, and liver tumor suppressor gene (p16) after exposing HepG2 cells to low-dose TCS (0.625\textendash 5 nM)for two weeks using HPLC\textendash MS/MS, Methylight, Q-MSP, Pyrosequencing, and Massarray methods. We found that low-dose TCS exposure decreased repetitive elements LINE-1 methylation levels, but not global DNA methylation, through down-regulating DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase 1) and MeCP2 (methylated DNA binding domain) expression, and up-regulating 8-hydroxy2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels. Interestingly, low-dose TCS elevated p16 gene methylation and inhibited p16 expression, which were not observed in high-dose (10 {$\mu$}M) group. Meanwhile, methyl-triclosan could not induce these two types of DNA methylation changes, suggesting the involvement of hydroxyl in TCS-mediated DNA methylation changes. Collectively, our results suggested low concentrations of TCS adversely affected HepG2 cells through DNA methylation dysregulation, and hydroxyl group in TCS played an important role in the effects. This study provided a better understanding on hepatotoxicity of TCS at environmentally relevant concentrations through epigenetic pathway.},

Methods\textemdash The study population comprises 6,604,975 children born from 1990 to 2002 in California. Autism cases (n = 19,238) were identified from 1990 through 2008 in databases of the California Department of Developmental Service, which coordinates services for people with developmental disorders. The outcome in this analysis was autism diagnosed before the child's sixth birth date.

Our previous study found that the alteration of the expression of AQPs 1, 3, 8, and 9 in placenta and fetal membranes was an adaptive response to maintain amniotic fluid homeostasis in case of abnormal amniotic fluid volume, which is likely to affect the intramembranous absorption and transport of water and solute from mother to fetus. However, the actual regulation mechanisms of intramembranous absorption and placental water flow are not yet clear, making it difficult to treat abnormal amniotic fluid volume effectively. Several studies found that many factors, including hormone levels, osmotic pressure, temperature, and oxygen concentration, regulate expression of AQPs in placenta, fetal membranes, and other mammalian organs through several signal transduction pathways, such as the cAMP, the MAPK, the PI3K/AKT, and the PKC pathways.

  abstract = {Background A large amount of organophosphate pesticides (OPs) are used in agriculture in China every year, contributing to exposure of OPs through dietary consumption among the general population. However, the level of exposure to OPs in China is still uncertain. Objective To investigate the effect of the exposure to OPs on the neonatal neurodevelopment during pregnancy in Shenyang, China. Methods 249 pregnant women enrolled in the Central Hospital Affiliated to Shenyang Medical College from February 2011 to August 2012. A cohort of the mothers and their neonates participated in the study and information on each subject was obtained by questionnaire. Dialkyl phosphate (DAP) metabolites were detected in the urine of mothers during pregnancy to evaluate the exposure level to OPs. Neonate neurobehavioral developmental levels were assessed according to the standards of the Neonatal Behavioral Neurological Assessment (NBNA). Multiple linear regressions were utilized to analyze the association between pregnancy exposure to OPs and neonatal neurobehavioral development. Results The geometric means (GM) of urinary metabolites for dimethyl phosphate (DMP), dimethyl thiophosphate (DMTP), diethyl phosphate (DEP), and diethyl thiophosphate (DETP) in pregnant women were 18.03, 8.53, 7.14, and 5.64 \textmu g/L, respectively. Results from multiple linear regressions showed that prenatal OP exposure was one of the most important factors affecting NBNA scores. Prenatal total DAP concentrations were inversely associated with scores on the NBNA scales.?Additionally, a 10-fold increase in DAP concentrations was associated with a decrease of 1.78 regarding the Summary NBNA (95\% CI, -2.12 to -1.45). And there was an estimated 2.11-point difference in summary NBNA scores between neonates in the highest quintile of prenatal OP exposure and the lowest quintile group. Conclusion The high exposure of pregnant women to OPs in Shenyang, China was the predominant risk factor for neonatal neurobehavioral development.},

Although epigenetic status in placenta is linked to fetal development, the mechanism behind this remains unknown. Because of the importance of DNA methylation in gene function, we set to explore whether or not DNA methylation in human placenta is also linked to fetal NTDs. Here we show for the first time that alteration of DNA methylation in placenta is closely associated with the phenotypes of fetal spina bifida (Sb). We found that patterns of DNA methylation for genes in neurological system process were differentially altered in the Sb placenta. In particular, the transcription regulatory regions of TRIM26 and GANS were kept at the hypomethylation status in Sb placenta alone. Accordingly, the protein levels of TRIM26 and GNAS were significantly elevated only in the Sb placenta but not in the Sb-affected fetuses. In cellular model of CHO cells deficient in Dihydrofolate reductase and treated with 5-aza-2{${'}$}-deoxycytidine, the protein levels of GNAS and TRIM26 were significantly higher than those in normal control cells. These findings suggested that epigenetic status of genes in placenta have profound impacts on the development of NTDs.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Triclosan is widely used in personal care products for its broad spectrum of antimicrobial effects, but triclosan is a potential endocrine disruptor. 11{$\beta$}-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11{$\beta$}-HSD2) is a cortisol-inactivating enzyme that is highly expressed in human placental syncytiotrophoblasts to ensure normal fetal development in the presence of high levels of maternal cortisol in pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effects of triclosan on 11{$\beta$}-HSD2 and apoptosis and the relationship between these two events in human placental syncytiotrophoblasts. DESIGN: Primary human placental cytotrophoblasts were isolated from term placenta. After syncytialization, the levels of 11{$\beta$}-HSD2 and apoptosis-related proteins including caspase3, Bcl-2, and Bax were examined after treatment with triclosan from 0.001 {$\mu$}M to 10 {$\mu$}M or triclosan (0.1 {$\mu$}M) in the presence and absence of apoptosis inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (30 {$\mu$}M) for 24 h. RESULTS: Triclosan inhibited 11{$\beta$}-HSD2 mRNA, protein and activity levels in a concentration-dependent manner from 0.001 to 10 {$\mu$}M with a significant inhibition at 0.01 {$\mu$}M and above. Concurrently, triclosan induced apoptosis of human placental syncytiotrophoblasts as demonstrated by observations of increased nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation and pro-apoptosis proteins such as Bax and cleaved-caspase3, decreased pro-caspase-3 and anti-apoptosis protein such as Bcl-2. Blocking apoptosis with Z-VAD-FMK attenuated the inhibition of 11{$\beta$}-HSD2 by triclosan significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Triclosan may attenuate the expression of placental 11{$\beta$}-HSD2 via the induction of apoptosis of placental syncytiotrophoblasts. This is likely to disrupt the placental glucocorticoid barrier and impair fetal development.},

  abstract = {The general population is exposed to phthalates through various sources and routes. Integration of omics data and epidemiological data is a key step toward directly linking phthalate biomonitoring data with biological response. Urine metabolomics is a powerful tool to identify exposure biomarkers and delineate the modes of action of environmental stressors. The objectives of this study are to investigate the association between low-level environmental phthalate exposure and urine metabolome alteration in male population, and to unveil the metabolic pathways involved in the mechanisms of phthalate toxicity. In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we studied the urine metabolomic profiles of 364 male subjects exposed to low-level environmental phthalates. Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) are the most widely used phthalates. {$\sum$}DEHP and MBP (the major metabolite of DBP) were associated with significant alteration of global urine metabolome in the male population. We observed significant increase in the levels of acetylneuraminic acid, carnitine C8:1, carnitine C18:0, cystine, phenylglycine, phenylpyruvic acid and glutamylphenylalanine; and meanwhile, decrease in the levels of carnitine C16:2, diacetylspermine, alanine, taurine, tryptophan, ornithine, methylglutaconic acid, hydroxyl-PEG2 and keto-PGE2 in high exposure group. The observations indicated that low-level environmental phthalate exposure associated with increased oxidative stress and fatty acid oxidation and decreased prostaglandin metabolism. Urea cycle, tryptophan and phenylalanine metabolism disruption was also observed. The urine metabolome disruption effects associated with {$\sum$}DEHP and MBP were similar, but not identical. The multibiomarker models presented AUC values of 0.845 and 0.834 for {$\sum$}DEHP and MBP, respectively. The predictive accuracy rates of established models were 81\% for {$\Sigma$}DEHP and 73\% for MBP. Our results suggest that low-level environmental phthalate exposure associates with urine metabolome disruption in male population, providing new insight into the early molecular events of phthalate exposure.},

  abstract = {Background The evaluation of the chemical impact on human health is usually constrained to the analysis of the health effects of exposure to a single chemical or a group of similar chemicals at one time. The effects of chemical mixtures are seldom analyzed. In this study, we applied three statistical models to assess the association between the exposure to a mixture of seven xenobiotics (three phthalate metabolites, two phenols, and two pesticides) and obesity. Methods Urinary levels of environmental phenols, pesticides, and phthalate metabolites were measured in adults who participated in the U.S.-based National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2013 to 2014. Body examination was conducted to determine obesity. We fitted multivariable models, using generalized linear (here both logistic and linear) regression, weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression, and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) models to estimate the association between chemical exposures and obesity. Results Of 1269 individuals included in our final analysis, 38.5\% had general obesity and 58.0\% had abdominal obesity. In the logistic regression model established for each single chemical, bisphenol S (BPS), mono (carboxyoctyl) phthalate (MCOP), and mono (2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP) were associated with both general and abdominal obesity (fourth vs. first quartile). In linear regression, MCOP was associated with BMI and waist circumference. In WQS regression analysis, the WQS index was significantly associated with both general obesity (OR = 1.63, 95\% CI: 1.21\textendash 2.20) and abdominal obesity (OR = 1.66, 95\% CI: 1.18\textendash 2.34). MCOP, bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol S (BPS), and mono ethyl phthalate (MEP) were the most heavily weighing chemicals. In BKMR analysis, the overall effect of mixture was significantly associated with general obesity when all the chemicals were at their 60th percentile or above it, compared to all of them at their 50th percentile. MCOP, BPA, and BPS showed positive trends. By contrast, MECPP showed a flat and modest inverse trend. Conclusion When comparing results from these three models, MCOP, BPA, and BPS were identified as the most important factors associated with obesity. We recommend estimating the joint effects of chemical mixtures by applying diverse statistical methods and interpreting their results together, considering their advantages and disadvantages.},

The aim of this study is to identify the diagnostic and poor prognostic signatures in TNBC by exploring the aberrant DNA methylation and gene expression. Differential expression and methylation analysis of the TNBC and paracancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas were performed. Gene set enrichment and protein\textendash protein interaction (PPI) network analysis was used to explore the mechanisms of TNBC. Methylation-gene expression correlation analysis was performed, and multivariate Cox analysis and receiver operating characteristics analysis were used to further screen the hub genes for TNBC. We identified 1,525 differentially expressed genes and 150 differentially methylated genes between TNBC and paracancer samples. About 96.64\% of the methylation sites were located on the CpG island. A total of 17 Gene Ontology biological process terms and 18 signal pathways were significantly enriched. GNG4, GNG11, PENK, MAOA, and AOX1 were identified as the core genes of the PPI network. Methylation-expression correlations revealed that ABCC9 (cg06951626), NKAPL (cg18675097, cg01031101, and cg17384889), and TMEM132C (cg03530754) showed promise as diagnostic and prognostic markers in TNBC.

  abstract = {Di (2-ethyl-hexyl)phthalate (DEHP) is an environmental endocrine disruptor and commonly used as plasticizer. Maternal DEHP exposure during pregnancy reduces placental size and destroys placental structure. However, the underlying mechanisms were unclear. In this study, we supposed that DEHP disturbs endocrine function of placenta to inhibit the proliferation of placental cell. Using radioimmunoassay and ELISA, we found that DEHP and its active metabolite mono (2-ethyl-hexyl) phthalate (MEHP) promoted progesterone secretion in pregnant mouse and in JEG-3~cells, respectively. Therefore, placental endocrine function was altered by DEHP. The mRNA and protein level of progesterone synthetase 3{$\beta$}-HSD1 was elevated by DEHP, which is conducive to the synthesis of progesterone. The level of progesterone receptor was down-regulated by DEHP and MEHP in mouse placenta and in JEG-3~cells, respectively. PR deficiency further promoted the level of 3{$\beta$}-HSD1, which leads to a higher progesterone level. In turn, higher concentration of progesterone further inhibited the expression of PGR (PR gene). Therefore, higher progesterone down-regulated the level of its receptor PR. Meanwhile, decreased PR induced more progesterone secretion. There is a feedback loop between progesterone and PR. PR deficiency down-regulated the protein level of Cyclin D1 which plays an important role in cell proliferation. Accordingly, DEHP and its active metabolite MEHP can restrain proliferation of placental cell and disturb the progesterone secretion via decreasing the level of PR.},

  abstract = {Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), one of the most widely used plasticizers in a number of day-life products, exerts both short-term and long-lasting effects on testicular steroidogenesis during in utero exposure. These actions might be caused by its primary metabolite, mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP). In the present study, we investigated the effects of MEHP on steroidogenesis of different stages of rat Leydig cells, progenitor (PLCs), immature (ILCs) and adult (ALCs). Results showed that MEHP affected reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation as well as androgen production in ALCs, but not in PLCs and ILCs, which coincided with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Low concentrations of MEHP (20\textendash 200 lM) provoked ROS perturbation and caused the stimulation of steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR), cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage (P450scc), 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (3b-HSD) and 17b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (17b-HSD) activities which elevated T production of ALCs. Contrast to the effect in low doses, high levels of MEHP (2000 lM and over) induced overloaded oxidative stress and inhibited steroidogenesis by reducing the activities of these enzymes in ALCs. These results indicated that oxidative stress and subsequent steroidogenic enzymes changes in ALCs were the potential underlying mechanism of the biphasic effects of DEHP on androgen production.},

Epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation might be a molecular mechanism through which phthalate exposure affects fetal growth. In this study, we examined associations between prenatal phthalate exposure, infant growth, and global DNA methylation in human placenta samples. We measured global DNA methylation of 119 subjects [55 fetal growth restriction (FGR) cases and 64 normal controls], as assessed by long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) methylation, via quantitative polymerase chain reaction-pyrosequencing. Prenatal phthalate exposure was assessed by measuring maternal urinary phthalate metabolites concentrations using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Concentrations of mono (2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), mono (2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), and SumDEHP (molar sum of MEHP, MEHHP, and MEOHP) were significantly higher in FGR cases than those in normal controls (P\,=\,0.002, 0.003, and 0.002, respectively). Placental LINE-1 methylation were found to be positively associated with fetal birth weight standard deviation scores, and negatively associated with urinary phthalate metabolites concentrations (MEHHP and SumDEHP). Every natural-log unit increase in urinary concentrations of MEHHP and SumDEHP was associated with 0.015 ({$\beta$}\,=\,-0.015, P\,=\,0.150) and 0.012 kg ({$\beta$}\,=\,-0.012, P\,=\,0.167) decrease in birth weight mediated through LINE-1 methylation. These findings suggest that changes in placental LINE-1 methylation might be part of the underlying biological pathway between prenatal phthalate exposure and adverse fetal growth.},

  abstract = {New high throughput technologies are now enabling simultaneous epigenetic profiling of DNA methylation at hundreds of thousands of CpGs across the genome. A problem of considerable practical interest is identification of large scale, global changes in methylation that are associated with environmental variables, clinical outcomes, or other experimental conditions. However, there has been little statistical research on methods for global methylation analysis using technologies with individual CpG resolution. To address this critical gap in the literature, we develop a new strategy for global analysis of methylation profiles using a functional regression approach wherein we approximate either the density or the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the methylation values for each individual using B-spline basis functions. The spline coefficients for each individual are allowed to summarize the individual's overall methylation profile. We then test for association between the overall distribution and a continuous or dichotomous outcome variable using a variance component score test that naturally accommodates the correlation between spline coefficients. Simulations indicate that our proposed approach has desirable power while protecting type I error. The method was applied to detect methylation differences, both genome wide and at LINE1 elements, between the blood samples from rheumatoid arthritis patients and healthy controls and to detect the epigenetic changes of human hepatocarcinogenesis in the context of alcohol abuse and hepatitis C virus infection. A free implementation of our methods in the R language is available in the Global Analysis of Methylation Profiles (GAMP) package at http://research.fhcrc.org/wu/en.html.},

Recent research suggests these effects might be mediated through the improper regulation of DNA methylation in offspring tissue. In this study, we examined associations between prenatal phthalate exposure and DNA methylation in human placenta. We recruited 181 mother-newborn pairs (80 fetal growth restriction newborns, 101 normal newborns) in Wenzhou, China and measured third trimester urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations and placental DNA methylation levels of IGF2 and AHRR. We found urinary concentrations of mono (2-ethyl-5- hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), and mono (2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP) were significantly inversely associated with placental IGF2 DNA methylation. The associations were much more evident in fetal growth restriction (FGR) newborns than those in normal newborns. These findings suggest that changes in placental DNA methylation might be part of the underlying biological pathway between prenatal phthalate exposure and adverse fetal growth.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The homeostasis of maternal-fetal fluid exchange is critically important in pregnancy. We sought to investigate the function of aquaporin 1 (AQP1) during pregnancy by examining fluid compartments of AQP1 knockout (AQP1-KO) mice. METHODS: Homozygous pregnant AQP1 knockout (KO) mice and control pregnant wild type CD1 mice were sacrificed. Placenta and fetal membranes were examined by immunohistochemical staining for expression of AQP1. The total number of embryos, atrophic embryos, and fetal and placental weight was recorded in each subgroup. Amniotic fluid amount in each sac was measured and amniotic fluid composition was determined. Analysis of variance of factorial design and one-factor analysis of variance were used for statistics. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry performed on CD1, though not AQP1-KO, placenta revealed that AQP1 was expressed at the vascular endothelial cell, trophocyte, and amnion epithelial cell. In AQP1-KOs, the number of embryos decreased with advancing gestational age. Although the fetal weight of AQP1-KO mice was significantly lower than wild type, amniotic fluid amount was increased in AQP1-KO mice. The AQP1-KO placenta demonstrated increased degeneration with evidence of altered blood vessel structure and increased syncytiotrophoblast nodules. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate a critical role of AQP1 in placental and fetal growth and maternal-fetal fluid homeostasis.},

  abstract = {DNA methylation in repetitive elements (RE) suppresses their mobility and maintains genomic stability, and decreases in it are frequently observed in tumor and/or surrogate tissues. Averaging methylation across RE in genome is widely used to quantify global methylation. However, methylation may vary in specific RE and play diverse roles in disease development, thus averaging methylation across RE may lose significant biological information. The ambiguous mapping of short reads by and high cost of current bisulfite sequencing platforms make them impractical for quantifying locus-specific RE methylation. Although microarray-based approaches (particularly Illumina's Infinium methylation arrays) provide cost-effective and robust genome-wide methylation quantification, the number of interrogated CpGs in RE remains limited. We report a random forest-based algorithm (and corresponding R package, REMP) that can accurately predict genome-wide locus-specific RE methylation based on Infinium array profiling data. We validated its prediction performance using alternative sequencing and microarray data. Testing its clinical utility with The Cancer Genome Atlas data demonstrated that our algorithm offers more comprehensively extended locus-specific RE methylation information that can be readily applied to large human studies in a cost-effective manner. Our work has the potential to improve our understanding of the role of global methylation in human diseases, especially cancer.},

  abstract = {Prenatal exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) exerts both short- and long-term adverse effects on the developing fetus. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects have yet to be uncovered. Maternal-fetal signaling is mediated in part by signaling molecules (eg, microRNAs [miRNAs]) contained in extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are released by the placenta into the maternal circulation. We investigated whether maternal exposure to the EDCs phthalates and personal care products alters the miRNA profile of placental-derived EVs circulating in maternal blood. Blood and urine samples from pregnant women with uncomplicated term dichorionic, diamniotic twin pregnancies were analyzed as part of a larger study investigating correlations between exposure of phthalate and personal care products and epigenetic alterations in twin pregnancies. We explored correlations between maternal urinary levels of 13 phthalate and 12 personal care products metabolites and the miRNA profile of placental EVs (EV-miRNAs) circulating in maternal blood. The expression of miR-518e was highest among women with high urinary levels of monobenzyl phthalate and methyl paraben. miR-373-3p was the least expressed in women exposed to high levels of methyl paraben, and miR-543 was significantly downregulated in women exposed to high levels of paraben metabolites, dichlorophenol metabolites, and triclosan. In conclusion, this pilot study reveals that prenatal exposure to EDCs is associated with altered profile of circulating placenta-derived EV-miRNAs. Further studies are needed to generalize these results to singleton pregnancies and to assess whether these alterations are associated with pregnancy complications.},

  abstract = {Objective There is concern over the potential placental effects of prenatal phthalate exposure, and the potential adverse effects of prenatal phthalate exposure require further study; however, few data are available in humans. We investigated the associations between phthalate exposure in each trimester and both placental size and shape at birth. Methods We measured the urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites among 2725 pregnant women in the Ma'anshan Birth Cohort. Before collecting urine samples from each of the three trimesters, the pregnant women were interviewed via questionnaires. Placental information was obtained from hospital records. We estimated the sex-specific associations between urinary phthalate concentrations in each trimester and both placental size and shape at birth using adjusted multiple regression. A linear mixed model was used for the repeated measures analysis with subject-specific random intercepts and slopes for gestational age at sample collection to test the effect of phthalate levels on placental size and shape and to estimate the effect sizes. Results Overall, placental breadth increased by 0.148cm (95\% CI: 0.078, 0.218) with each 1 ln-concentration increase in MBP in the first trimester. The difference between placental length and breadth (length\textendash breadth) decreased by 0.086cm (95\% CI: -0.159, -0.012) and 0.149cm (95\% CI: -0.221, -0.076) with each 1 ln-concentration increase in MMP and MBP, respectively, in the first trimester. In the second trimester, placental thickness increased by 0.017cm (95\% CI: 0.006, 0.027), 0.020cm (95\% CI: 0.004, 0.036), 0.028cm (95\% CI: 0.007, 0.048), and 0.035cm (95\% CI: 0.018, 0.053) with each 1 ln-concentration increase in MMP, MBP, MEOHP, and MEHHP, respectively. In the third trimester, placental thickness increased by 0.037cm (95\% CI: 0.019, 0.056) and 0.019cm (95\% CI: 0, 0.037) with each 1 ln-concentration increase in MBP and MEHP, respectively. Multiple linear regression for each offspring sex indicated that prenatal phthalate exposure increased placental thickness in both the first and second trimesters in males, whereas the corresponding relationship was close to null in females. Linear mixed models (LMMs) yielded similar results. Conclusion Our results suggest the presence of associations between prenatal phthalate exposure and placental size and shape. Exposure to certain phthalates may cause the placenta to become thicker and more circular. Associations appeared stronger for the subsample representing male offspring than those for the subsample representing female offspring. Given the few studies on this topic, additional research is warranted.},

  abstract = {PROM is one of the common complications of perinatal period, which seriously threatens the mother and newborn. The purpose of this study was to identify the role of NLRC4 inflammasomes in this process and their underlying mechanisms. We performed high-throughput RNA sequencing of fetal membrane tissue from 3 normal pregnant women and 3 term-premature rupture of fetal membrane (TPROM) patients who met the inclusion criteria, and found that NLRC4 was significantly up-regulated in TPROM patients. An observational study of TPROM patients (PROM group, n = 30) and normal pregnant women (control group, n = 30) was performed at the Xuzhou Maternal and Child Health Hospital affiliated to Xuzhou Medical University from May 2018 to May 2019. The expression of genes involved in inflammasome complex including NLRC1, NLRC3, AIM2, NLRC4, ASC, caspase-1, IL-6, IL-18 and IL-1{$\beta$}was determined via real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Measurement of NLRC4 level in serum was conducted by ELISA assay. The results showed that the NLRC4, ASC, caspase-1, IL-1{$\beta$} and IL-18 levels in fetal membrane, placental tissues and maternal serum were markedly higher in the PROM group than that in the control group. In conclusion, NLRC4 is a markedly up-regulated gene in TPROM fetal membrane tissue, suggesting that NLRC4 is involved in the occurrence and development of TPROM; NLRC4 levels in maternal blood serum are closely related to TPROM and have the potential to assist doctors in predicting and diagnosing PROM.},

Here we probed the molecular recognition process of halogenated BPAs including TBBPA, TCBPA, BPAF, BPC, triBBPA, diBBPA, and monoBBPA toward PPAR{$\gamma$} and ER{$\alpha$} by molecular modeling, especially the impact of different halogen patterns. Increasing bromination at phenolic rings of BPAs was found highly correlated with electrostatic interactions (R2 = 0.978 and 0.865 toward PPAR{$\gamma$} and ER{$\alpha$}, respectively) and van der Waals interactions (R2 = 0.995 and 0.994 toward PPAR{$\gamma$} and ER{$\alpha$}, respectively). More halogenated phenolic rings at 3,5-positions of BPAs increase the shielding of the hormonally active phenolic OH and markedly decrease electrostatic interactions favorable for agonistic activities toward PPAR{$\gamma$}, but unfavorable for agonistic activities toward ER{$\alpha$}. The halogenation at the phenolic rings of BPAs exerts more impact on molecular electrostatic potential distribution than halogenation at the bridging alkyl moiety. Different halogenations further alter hydrogen bond interactions of BPAs and induce conformational changes of PPAR{$\gamma$} ligand binding domain (LBD) and ER{$\alpha$} LBD, specifically affecting the stabilization of helix H12 attributable to the different agonistic activities. Our results indicate that structural variations in halogenation patterns result in different interactions of BPAs with PPAR{$\gamma$} LBD and ER{$\alpha$} LBD, potentially causing distinct agonistic/antagonistic toxic effects. The various halogenation patterns should be fully considered for the design of future environmentally benign chemicals with reduced toxicities and desired properties.},

The gamma-radiolytic decomposition and chloride formation follows an apparent first order kinetic, kde/kCl = 3. For complete removal of 500 microM 2,4-D, a dose of 4 kGy is required. Phenolic intermediates (2,4-dichlorophenol, the isomers 2-chloro-4-hydroxy- and 4-chloro-2-hydroxy phenoxyacetic acid and three hydroxylation products of 2,4-D) are formed. Using oxygen saturation during irradiation, they are removed again with a dose of 4 kGy. For the formation of the main organic product acetic acid a reaction mechanism is discussed. Oxygen concentration enhances strongly fragmentation and mineralization. A reduction of 36\% TOC could be achieved.},

DEHP exposure reduces embryo implantations, increases embryonic loss, and decreases fetal body weights. However, no detailed information is available about the effect of DEHP on the placentation during pregnancy. Thus, our aim was to explore the effect of DEHP on the growth and development of placenta in vivo. Mice were administered DEHP by gavages at 125, 250, 500 mg/kg/day from gestational days (GD) 1 until sacrifice. Results showed that DEHP treatment significantly reduced the weight of placenta at GD 13. Histopathologically, in DEHP-treated group, the ectoplacental cones significantly became smaller at GD9, and total area of placenta and area of spongiotrophoblast were significantly reduced at GD 13. Expression levels of Ascl2, Esx1 and Fosl1 mRNA dramatically decreased in DEHP-treated placenta at GD 13. DEHP administration disrupted labyrinth vascularization of placentas, and inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of placenta by the activation of caspase-3 and -8, up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-2 mRNA and protein at GD 13. In conclusion, these results suggest that adverse pregnancy outcomes including low birth-weight and pregnancy loss exposed to DEHP are possibly mediated, at least in part, via the suppression of placental growth and development.},

  abstract = {Triclosan (5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol) is a potent antibacterial and antifungal compound that is widely used in personal care products, plastics, and fabrics. Recently triclosan has been shown to alter endocrine function in a variety of species. The purpose of this study was to determine effects of triclosan on pubertal development and thyroid hormone concentrations in the male rat. Weanling rats were exposed to 0, 3, 30, 100, 200, or 300 mg/kg of triclosan by oral gavage from postnatal day (PND) 23 to 53. Preputial separation (PPS) was examined beginning on PND 33. Rats were killed on PND 53, organ weights were recorded and serum was collected for subsequent analysis. Triclosan did not affect growth or the onset of PPS. Serum testosterone was significantly decreased at 200 mg/kg, however no effects were observed on androgen-dependent reproductive tissue weights. Triclosan significantly decreased total serum thyroxine (T4) in a dose-dependent manner at 30 mg/kg and higher (no observed effect level of 3 mg/kg). Triiodothyronine (T3) was significantly decreased only at 200 mg/kg, but thyroid stimulating hormone was not statistically different at any dose. Liver weights were significantly increased at 100 mg/kg triclosan and above suggesting that the induction of hepatic enzymes may have contributed to the altered T4 and T3 concentrations, but it does not appear to correlate with the T4 dose-response. This study demonstrates that triclosan exposure does not alter androgen-dependent tissue weights or onset of PPS; however, triclosan exposure significantly impacts thyroid hormone concentrations in the male juvenile rat.},

The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.},

  abstract = {In an epidemiological study the regression slope between a response and predictor variable is underestimated when the predictor variable is measured imprecisely. Repeat measurements of the predictor in individuals in a subset of the study or in a separate study can be used to estimate a multiplicative factor to correct for this 'regression dilution bias'. In applied statistics publications various methods have been used to estimate this correction factor. Here we compare six different estimation methods and explain how they fall into two categories, namely regression and correlation-based methods. We provide new asymptotic variance formulae for the optimal correction factors in each category, when these are estimated from the repeat measurements subset alone, and show analytically and by simulation that the correlation method of choice gives uniformly lower variance. The simulations also show that, when the correction factor is not much greater than 1, this correlation method gives a correction factor which is closer to the true value than that from the best regression method on up to 80\% of occasions. We also provide a variance formula for a modified correlation method which uses the standard deviation of the predictor variable in the main study; this shows further improved performance provided that the correction factor is not too extreme. A confidence interval for a corrected regression slope in an epidemiological study should reflect the imprecision of both the uncorrected slope and the estimated correction factor. We provide formulae for this and show that, particularly when the correction factor is large and the size of the subset of repeat measures is small, the effect of allowing for imprecision in the estimated correction factor can be substantial.},
